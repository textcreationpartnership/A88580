            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:115133:3"/>married his widow, whereby God hath made the <hi>ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to dwell,</hi> and <hi>reſt in the houſe of her husband,</hi> and hath cauſed a mournful widow to <hi>forget her ſorrows.</hi> And your right (deare Miſtreſſe <hi>Bradſhaw</hi>) is very great to the works of this worthy man, as having had the honour for ſeveral yeeres to be the wife of this eminent ſervant and Ambaſſadour of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And my hope is, that as your coming together in this dear relation, was the anſwer of many prayers: ſo you will in the ſtrength of prayers, ſtill comfortably live together, <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.7.</note>

Theſe Sermons (as the date of them will ſhew) were preached by Mr. <hi>LOVE,</hi> but a few moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his impriſonment and death: his gracious heart it

And although our oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions have not allowed us leaſure to peruſe the ſeveral pieces which have been already publiſhed
(upon the peruſal of ſome of our Brethren) yet with humble thankfulneſſe unto God, we heartily rejoyce in that acceptance with ſucceſſe, which they have found in the hearts of ſober ſavoury Chriſtians. This Treatiſe (which was the matter of ſome of his laſt Sermons) had more of the Authors heart and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation (as he teſtified unto two of us, not many days before his death) then any other of his Works. And truly, the effects of this diſcourſe (the happie iſſue of his ſpiritual combate) were admirably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon his own heart, in the ſparkling influences of Gods holy Spirit, whereby he was extraordinarily 
<pb facs="tcp:115133:5"/>elevated above all ſublunary comforts, or croſſes; loves, or ſorrows; hopes, or feares, when his known death drew very nigh: for though he was a man very full of affections, and of ſingular tenderneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his dearly-beloved wife and children: yet he had not onely conquered ſuch ſinful diſtempers, as too frequently prevaile wofully amongſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Profeſſors of Religion, but had alſo in ſuch meaſure got above natural exorbitances; that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by Faith and Prayer, put his neareſt Relations into the boſome of his God and father, he went to the Block without any expreſſion of perplexity. Oh that his experience might encourage both the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours and hopes of other Chriſtians to attaine the like gracious frame of heart, which would tend much to the credit of the Goſpel; for this end we commend thee in the uſe of this Book, (and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holy helps) unto the bleſſing of the Almighty, deſiring thy prayers.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. For anſwer hereto, it cannot be meant (as <hi>Toſtatus</hi> and others) of the age of mans life, as if man ſhould now becauſe of their wickedneſſe have ſhorter lives, becauſe after the flood men did live longer then the terme of an hundred and twenty yeares; <hi>Sem</hi> lived
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115133:7"/>600 yeares, <hi>Arphaxad</hi> 425 yeares, and <hi>Serug</hi> 230. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> 175. <hi>Iſaac</hi> 180. The meaning then is this, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I will remove my Spirit from my Ordinances, yet his dayes ſhall be an hundred and twenty years, that is, it ſhall be an hundred and twenty yeares before the flood come upon them.</p>
                  <p>But now there is an objection lies in this, how it ſhould be an hundred and twenty years before the flood ſhould come, when theſe words were ſpoken, when <hi>Noah</hi> was five hundred years old, and the flood came when he was ſix hundred yeares old, therefore here is twenty yeares ſhorter then Gods promiſe?</p>
                  <p>This is an intricate knot, and interpreters are forced to take much paines to untie it, and to vindicate the faithfulneſſe of God herein, let God be true and every man a lier. <hi>Jerome</hi> he gives this anſwer, ſaies he, It is true, God did promiſe an hundred and twenty years between the making of the promiſe and the accompliſhment; the wickedneſſe of men grew ſo great, and did ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God, that he did contract the promiſe to twenty years leſſe; and thus <hi>Muſculus</hi> alſo, who farther ſaies, God making promiſe reſerves the condition in his own breaſt; for as God may not bring a judgement threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a people, upon their ſpeedy repentance, as in the caſe of the Ninevites: ſo neither is he bound to give them a mercy promiſed, in caſe of wilful and obſtinate and incorrigible wickedneſſe, as in the caſe of <hi>Elies</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. <hi>I ſaid</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Eli</hi>) <hi>that thy houſe, and the houſe of thy father ſhould walk before me for ever, But now the Lord ſaith, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e it farre from me, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the beſt and genuine anſwer given hereto, is this, that this promiſe was made to <hi>Noah,</hi> not when he was five hundred yeares old, but when he was four hundred and fourſcore; for though it be ſaid in the fifth chapter and the laſt verſe, that <hi>Noah</hi> was five hundred yeares old, yet that text doth not ſay he was ſo old when this promiſe was made.—Thus <hi>Rivet, Mercer</hi> and others.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115133:7"/>There is one difficulty in this anſwer; It may be objected that this promiſe was made after <hi>Noah</hi> was ſaid to be five hundred years old. <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.30.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, that in Scripture it is uſual, in the relating of Hiſtories not to obſerve an exact order, <note place="margin">Gen. 1.21.</note> ſo that ſome things may be placed before which may be done after, and ſome things after which may be done before, as for inſtance you may read of the womans cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation after the ſeventh day; <hi>Moſes</hi> would not obſerve a direct order, but did put thoſe things after which were done before.—And ſo likewiſe another inſtance you have of a thing put before, done afterwards. In the caſe of <hi>Terah</hi> you reade that he was two hundred and five years old, and he died, <note place="margin">Gen. 11.32.</note> and yet you finde that <hi>Iſaac's</hi> birth is not mentioned until ſome ten chapters after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, whereas <hi>Terah</hi> lived ſome thirty five years after the birth of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> I only mention this to ſhew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of this anſwer with other places of Scripture; to which may be added what judicious <hi>Calvin</hi> hath to ſolve this doubt, that though it be ſaid that <hi>Noah</hi> was ſix hundred years old, when he was but five hundred and eighty, yet becauſe he was going in the ſix hundreth year, and ſo near it as twenty yeares, therefore the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Noah</hi> was ſix hundred years, expreſſing his age by a whole number. Thus you have the difficulties explained.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Spirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man, &amp;c.</hi> It may be obſerved from the whole that when God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the judgement of a flood, he threatened a worſe judgement before it; to note that Gods withdrawing his ordinances, or withdrawing the efficacy of his Spirit from his ordinances, was a worſe puniſhment then any bodily puniſhment. I mention this in the prologue to the point, that ſo when you hear me handle the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſneſſe of this judgement, you may look upon it as a moſt ſad and heavy one.</p>
                  <p>And yet before I raiſe the doctrine, I muſt diſtinguiſh 
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115133:8"/>to you about a double withdrawing of Gods Spirit, when the Scripture ſaies, <hi>My Spirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man,</hi> it includes two things.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. To demonſtrate the truth of the firſt, I ſhall lay down but this one evidence. It appears to be ſo great a judgement, becauſe when the Spirit is withheld from the ordinances, there can be no efficacy in them to convert a ſoul. A ſword in a living mans hand may pierce and wound, but a painted ſword in a painted mans hand upon the wall can do nothing at all: ſo the word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the Spirit of God can do no more then a ſword in the hand of a <hi>George</hi> on horſeback; it may pleaſe the phanſie and tickle the eare, but never pierce the heart; it muſt be the Spirit of God which works up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart: <hi>Ye are the epistle of Chriſt</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aies the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.3</note> And as the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>My preaching was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115133:8"/>not with inticing words of mans wiſdome, but in demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit and of power.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.4.</note> It muſt be the mighty power of God which works upon the heart. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the word it is like that poole of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">John 5.4.</note> there was no native vertue in the water to heale; but the text ſaies, when <hi>the Angel did move the water, he that firſt ſtept in was healed of whatſoever diſeaſe he had.</hi> Ordinances they are like this poole; there is no native vertue in bare preaching, and bare hearing; but it muſt be the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God which muſt move upon theſe waters, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they become not effectual: <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.6.</note>
                     <hi>The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life;</hi> which words are not to be underſtood in <hi>Origens</hi> ſenſe, the letter, that is the literal ſenſe, and the Spirit, that is, the allegorical ſenſe; neither the meaning is, the letter, that is, the Old Teſtament, and the Spirit, that is, the New Teſtament, as the Antinomians ſay; but the meaning of the word, the letter, that is, the word of God abſtractively conſidered from the Spirit of God, that kills, it leaves a man in a dead eſtate; but it is the Spirit which gives life, that is, the Spirit backing the Miniſtery of the word, makes it effectual to give Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life. Thus it appeares to be a grievous judgement when the Spirit is withheld from the Ordinances of God, becauſe without the Spirit there can be no benefit at all by Ordinances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The next thing is to ſhew, for what reaſon it is that God ſends this grievous judgement upon any people.</p>
                  <p>For anſwer whereto I ſhall ſay down ſome reaſons in the general, and then ſome in particular.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 In the general, the reaſon, why God withholds or withdrawes the operation and working of his Spirit in his Ordinances, <note place="margin">Res delicatula eſt ſpiritus Dei; ita nos tractat, ſicut tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tatur.</note> it is from that injury or offence that men have done to the Spirit of God; if men grieve the Spirit, and quench its motions, it is juſt with God to withhold its workings and operations. The Scripture mentions a ſix-fold wrong done unto the Spirit of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115133:9"/>God, for one, or all of which the Lord may withdraw his Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a quenching of the Spirit, <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.19</note> 
                     <hi>Quench not the Spirit.</hi> By quenching the Spirit is meant any act of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or ſlighting of the Spirits motions in our hearts; take heed therefore of omitting good duties, or neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its motions; for how know you but that the Lord may withdraw his Spirit from you? The winde may ceaſe to blow, if when it blowes, we do not get our ſailes ready.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another injury which is of a higher nature, is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Spirit, <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.30</note> 
                     <hi>And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are ſealed unto the day of redemption.</hi> Then do you grieve the Spirit, when you ſhall do any ſinful act, for which the Spirit checks you, and yet you will run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the committing of it, when you ſhall hearken rather to the motions of ſinne then the motions of the Spirit, to Satanical deluſions rather then the Spirits motions; this grieves the Spirit exceedingly, as it will grieve a friend when we leave his counſel, and follow rather the counſel of an enemy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another injury done againſt the Spirit, is vexing the Spirit, <hi>They rebelled, and vexed his Holy Spirit.</hi> And this is a higher degree; <note place="margin">Eſay 36.10.</note> for then may a man be ſaid to vex the Spirit, when he quenches the Spirit, and grieves the Spirit, and doth ſo by many reiterated acts, hereby is the Spirit grieved. A man is grieved when his friend doth him one diſcourtiſie; but when he ſhall perſiſt in the doing of more, this raiſeth up vexation in him: Even ſo is it with the Spirit of God, when we ſlight its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and notwithſtanding its warnings, will yet venture upon the committing of ſinne, we not only grieve but alſo vex the Spirit; <note place="margin">Iſa. 63.4.</note> and ſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>They rebelled, and vexed his Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another Scripture expreſſion of wrong done to the Spirit, is reſiſting of the Spirit, <hi>Ye do alwayes reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Acts 7.51.</note> and this is a higher degree then any of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115133:9"/>former; for reſiſting of the Spirit, is when a man knows ſuch and ſuch motions are from the Spirit, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding will ſtand out obſtinately againſt its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions and motions.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another expreſſion in Scripture, is <note place="margin">Acts 5.7.</note>
                     <hi>a tempting of the Spirit; How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Calvin</hi> explaines this place, and ſaies, that their tempting of the Spirit was this, <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> having ſold a poſſeſſion, brought a part of the price thereof and laid it at the Apoſtles feet, and kept back the reſt, and they would carry it ſo ſecretly, that they would try whether the Holy Ghoſt was an omniſcient God, able to puniſh that ſecret ſinne. Now this was a higher kinde of wickedneſſe, and a moſt deſperate pitch of Atheiſme, to try the omniſciency of the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And laſtly, another injury the Scripture expreſſes, <note place="margin">Heb. 10.29.</note> is <hi>a doing deſpite to the Spirit of Grace,</hi> and this is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry top of all, the higheſt injury that a devil in hell, or a man on earth can do to the Spirit. This is the ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Which ſhall never be forgiven.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 12.31.</note> Now what is this deſpite? it cannot be to neglect good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for godly men may be, and are overtaken with thoſe neglects; the not hearkening to a friends motion, is not a doing of deſpite to him. Therefore there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a deſpite done to the Spirit of God, but there muſt be theſe ingredients in it; as

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115133:10"/> is this, that it is a ſinne committed out of malice and hatred to the Spirit of God; and this Divines apply to the Phariſees, who knew and were convinced by the Miracles which Chriſt wrought, that he was the Son of God, and yet though they knew and were perſwaded of this, yet out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt the Deity of Chriſt they would put him to death; ſo that to ſumme up all together, this is the general reaſon why God will not ſuffer his Spirit to ſtrive with men, becauſe of thoſe injuries which they do unto the Spirit of God. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reaſons may be theſe.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Deſpiſing of the Ordinance of the Miniſtery. I will not ſay the perſons of the Miniſters, though that is an evill which God will puniſh; but certainly a contempt of the Miniſtery, of the Ordinance of Preaching, it may provoke God to withdraw the operations of his Spirit; if you deſpiſe prophecying, you alſo quench the Spirit, and then the Spirit will not have thoſe operations upon you which otherwiſe it would. <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.19.</note> God will not follow the Word with efficacy to them who either contemne or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Miniſtery thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another reaſon may be, becauſe men do too much depend upon the hearing of the Word preached. Men come to hear the Word preached in the ſtrength of their <hi>own ſpirits,</hi> and therefore God will not give them the workings of <hi>his Spirit.</hi> When men ſhall depend upon Ordinances, it is juſt with God to deny the benefit of them; <note place="margin">1 Sam. 4.2,3.</note> 
                     <hi>as the Iſraelites having received an overthrow</hi> by the Philiſtines. Wherein they loſt about four thouſand men, looked upon this as the reaſon, becauſe they had not the <hi>Arke</hi> of God among them; but when they had the <hi>Arke</hi> with them, it is ſaid the ſecond day there fell of the Iſraelites thirty thouſand men. Thus did God puniſh their ſinful dependance on the outward badge of his preſence, and therefore they had leſſe ſucceſſe when they had the <hi>Arke,</hi> then when they were without
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115133:10"/>it; God may deny the operations of his Spirit in his Ordinances, becauſe men do ſinfully depend upon them, and not look to the God of the Ordinances for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his Spirit. We muſt look to Ordinances as the meanes, but to the Spirit of God as the Author of grace; the Ordinances cannot without the Spirit do us good, and the Spirit without the Ordinances ordinarily will not. Therefore we muſt neither refuſe Ordinances, nor reſt in them, leſt Gods Spirit depart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God may withhold his Spirit from the Word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men withhold preparation from the Word they hear; <hi>With what meaſure you mete, it ſhall be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to you again,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark. 4.24.</note> It is ſpoken of hearing of the Word; as you meaſure to God in an holy endeavour to prepare for hearing, God by his Spirit will proportion to you a bleſſing in hearing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Generall unfruitfulneſſe under fruitful Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that may be another cauſe. When men ſit under the droppings of Heaven, as it were, and are yet barren, this may provoke God to do as he did with his Vineyard, to take away the hedge, and let the beaſts of the field de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, and that no rain fall on it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. when men increaſe in ſin, <note place="margin">Iſa. 5.3.</note> who attend on the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Word; and thus it was with the old world, who enjoyed the Miniſtery of <hi>Noah, Methuſalah,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holy men, and yet their wickedneſſe grew exceeding great, which did greatly provoke God, and cauſed him to withdraw his Spirit that it ſhould not any longer ſtrive with them.</p>

I ſhall give you three famous inſtances hereof, wherein the Spirit refuſes to teach men immediately, but leaves them to an outward Miniſtery. One whereof you haves concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ethiopian Eunuch, who reading in his Chariot the Prophecie of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and the Spirt obſerving him how he read, and could not underſtand, bids <hi>Philip go neare, and joyne himſelf to his Chariot,</hi> and expound to him what he read; <note place="margin">Acts 8.29.</note> the Spirit would not do it immediately himſelf, but bids <hi>Philip</hi> go. Interpreters obſerve hence, what a dignity the Spirit of God puts on the Miniſtery of the Word; that in thoſe times when Viſions and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were in uſe, yet God eſtabliſht the Miniſtery.</p>
                  <p>Another inſtance you have of <hi>Paul</hi> at his converſion, <note place="margin">Act. 9.4. &amp;c.</note> when he ſaw that Viſion, and heard that voice, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> and crying out, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Now Chriſt would not tell <hi>Paul</hi> immediately, but ſaies he, <hi>Go to Damaſcus, and thertehou ſhalt meet with</hi> Ananias, <hi>and he will tell thee
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115133:13"/>what thou ſhalt do.</hi> Thus Chriſt he would not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately himſelf teach <hi>Paul,</hi> but ſends him to <hi>Ananias,</hi> that he might ſet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Another example you have of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> when he ſaw the <hi>Angel, and was ſore afraid, and ſaid, What is it Lord? The Lord he bids him ſend for</hi> Peter, <hi>and he ſhould ſhew him what he ought to do.</hi> Thus doth the Lord dignifie the Miniſtery of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>I mention this particular the rather, to ſhew the vanity of Enthuſiaſme, that would aboliſh the Miniſtery, and cry up the Spirits immediate teaching; but here we ſee the great dignity which the Spirit ſets on the Miniſtery of poor weak and fraile man, in that he will not teack men immediately, but ſends them to the Miniſtery of the Goſpel.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That Gods Spirit is a free agent, and is not to be tied to an outward Miniſtery, but to be left at liberty to work how, when, and in what manner he pleaſes. <hi>The winde bloweth where it liſteth, even ſo is every man which is born of the Spirit.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 3.8.</note> By the wind is meant the Spirit. There is a Sovereignty and free agency in the Spirit of God to work when he pleaſes, or to withhold working from whom he pleaſes; And therefore the Spirit of God is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a free Spirit, <hi>Pſal</hi> 51.12. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>phold me with thy free Spirit;</hi> and <hi>James</hi> 1.18 <hi>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider that God doth not withhold his Spirit from the outward Miniſtery, meerly as an act of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, but as an act of his Juſtice, <hi>becauſe of your ſins whereby you have provoked him.</hi> You provoke him to withhold the efficacy of his Spirit from his Ordinances by your ſins, and therefore are you hardened, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not benefit by them; you do ſome of thoſe inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the Spirit, as quenching, grieving, reſiſting, vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tempting and deſpiſing the Spirit (which I mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before;) therefore do not think hardly of God, but judge your ſelves. Sinne was the cauſe which made the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115133:14"/>Lord withdraw his Spirit, that it ſhould not ſtrive with the men of the old world; it was their diſobedience, as you finde the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking, <hi>Christ by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit went and preached unto the ſpirits in priſon, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were diſobedient, when once the long-ſuffering of God waited in the dayes of Noah;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet 3.19.20.</note> their diſobedience made God withdraw the efficacy of his Spirit; if therefore the Spirit do not work on you, think not hardly on God, but thank your ſelves, he is provoked unto it. Thus God departed from the Iſraelites, becauſe of their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full provocations, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 81.11,12.—<hi>But my people would not hearken to my voice, and Iſrael would none of me. So I gave them up unto their own hearts luſts, and they walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their own wayes.</hi> The Spirit in Scripture is compared to a Dove; now a Dove will alwayes keep in the houſe where it is bred, unleſſe the Dove-houſe be naſtily kept. The Spirit of God in this may fitly be reſembled by a Dove; keep your hearts clean, and the Spirit will abide with you; keep them naſty; and the Spirit will ſoone leave you; ſin is the cauſe why the Spirit withdraws it ſelf from the Ordinances, and why men are left unto themſelves, and God doth it as an act of his juſtice, puniſhing of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If God do withhold his Spirit from the Miniſtery of the Word, the fault is rather to be imputed to thy ſelf, then unto the Word. Many like the woman in <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> complaine the roome is dark, when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are blinde, and the place wants no light, but they want eyes: Or to him that preaches the Word, uſually if men do not profit by the hearing of the word, the blame is caſt upon the Miniſter; and truly we Miniſters have our faults as well as others, if we preach not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, methodically, and duly there is a fault in us; but yet I ſay, you are rather to blame your ſelves, then either the Word, or the Miniſter thereof: If the ſeed grow not, the fault is neither in the hand of the husbandman, nor in the influence of the heavens, but in the badneſſe of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115133:15"/>the ſoile. That you may know where the fault lies; conſider</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If a Miniſter preaches plainly and impartially, and yet thou getteſt no good by him, the fault is thy own, not his. It was the Herodians fault, not Chriſts, that thoſe perſons profited not by Chriſts preaching, for they themſelves give this teſtimony of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.16. <hi>Maſter, we know that thou art true, and teacheſt the way of God in truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If other men get good by his Miniſtery, and not thou, the fault is thine, not his; If at a feaſt others are fed, &amp; thou famiſht, the fault is in thy ſtomach, not meat.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In caſe you have formerly got good by a Miniſter, but now you get none, formerly your affections were ſtirred up, your deſires were increaſed, your love infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but now no ſuch effect, the fault is thine own; It was the fault of the hearers of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> the fault was not in <hi>John's</hi> Doctrine, that <hi>they rejoyced onely for a ſeaſon;</hi> this alſo was the fault of the Galatians that they profited not by <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtery as before, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.16. <note place="margin">Gal. 4.16.</note> This cometh not from the ſeed it ſelf, but from the badneſſe of the ground into which it is caſt. If thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteſt not by the Word thou heareſt, thou art to blame thine own naughty heart, not the Word, or the diſpenſer thereof.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though there is much dignity and excellency to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the Word of God nakedly conſidered, yet there is no efficacy in it to convert a ſoul without the Spirits' concurrence; As it was in the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> not the water, nor ſtepping into it healed, but the Angels mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therein, <hi>John</hi> 5.4. So alſo, not the Word alone, nor hearing of it, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.6.</note> but the Spirit healeth; <hi>The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life,</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) that is, the Word without the Spirit, it is only the Spirit which can give life: The Spirit without the Word will not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily convert, and the Word without the Spirit cannot. <hi>I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 57.19.</note> by the fruit of the 
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115133:15"/>lips the Prophet underſtands a Goſpel-Miniſtery, but ſayes God I muſt not create peace by the fruit of the lips. it is the working of the Spirit with the Word, which makes the Word to become effectual; and therefore the Goſpel is called the Miniſtery of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8,9.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is a worſe judgement to have the Spirit withheld from the Word, then to be without the Word; and the reaſon is this, becauſe the Spirit can convert a man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Word, but the Word can never convert a man without the Spirit; and therefore it is a worſe judgement for thee to hear Sermons every day, and to have the Spirits concurrent efficacy withheld from thoſe Sermons, then if thou ſhouldeſt never learn a Sermon in all thy life-time; therefore pray unto God that his own Spirit may accompany his own Word and Ordinances to make them effectuall for the good of thy ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Spirit of God may be for a time withheld from Gods own people, that it ſhall not attend an outward Miniſtery, and this is a very ſad judgement; it may be withheld from Gods elect in a converting way. As the man lay 38. yeers at the poole of <hi>Betheſda</hi> before he was healed; ſo an elect veſſell of God may lie twenty, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or fourty yeers in a ſtate of unregeneracy before he is converted. Nay, after converſion the Spirit of God may be withheld from the Miniſtery of the Word, which Gods own people attend upon, and that in theſe two wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In its Comforting work, and thus it was with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Lord, ſaies he, <hi>take not thy holy Spirit from me; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore unto me the joy of thy ſalvation,</hi> and <hi>stabliſh me with thy free Spirit;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 51.11.12.</note> thus was the Spirit withdrawn from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in its comforting work. I do not tell you the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods children can be taken away, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of their graces, and of the Spirit of God may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God may withhold his Spirit in its quickening 
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115133:16"/>work, thou mayeſt come to an Ordinance with a hard heart, and it may not ſoften thee; though the preſence of God is never utterly taken away from a godly man, yet the influences and quickenings of Gods Spirit may be withdrawn; the Spirit may be withdrawn in a quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way, ſo as in grace thou mayeſt decay, and in duty thou mayeſt grow cold and dull, but yet the preſence of God ſhall never be taken away from a godly man. There is the ſame Sun in the firmament in winter as in ſummer, but not the warme working and quickening influence.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And laſtly, The Spirit of God may be given to men waiting on a publike Miniſtery in its common workings, and yet it may be withheld from them in its ſaving and effectuall operations; and thus it was with the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, many of them had the Spirit to attend <hi>Pauls</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery in the common workings of it, but yet not in its ſaving effects, and therefore ſaies <hi>Paul, Though you come behinde in no gifts, yet I must ſpeak unto you as carnal;</hi> look to your ſelves therefore, the Spirit in its common workings may attend the Miniſtery to fill you with noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet it may be withheld in regard of its ſaving ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>

                     </label> For anſwer hereunto, you muſt know that this is a very dark point, and hardly determined, and therefore many of the particulars I ſhall give in anſwer to it, they ſhall be but probable conjectures rather then infallible Demonſtrations; There are many things that give me to fear that in part the ſaving operations of the Spirit are withheld from the Miniſtery of the Word.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And firſt, we have cauſe to fear that in part the Spirit is withdrawn from the Miniſtery of the Word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, becauſe there are fewer which are converted by the Miniſtery of the Word now, then there were in former times; now the Spirit ceaſes to back the Miniſtery of the Word with numerous numbers of Converts, it is an argument that the Spirit is in part withdrawn. When the Diſciples did firſt preach the Goſpel, how did Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115133:17"/>fall down like lightening before the Word; there were three thouſand converted in one day by <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon; and how may we preach three thouſand times, and yet not convert one? <note place="margin">Acts 2.41.</note> Multitudes were brought in and converted in the morning of the Goſpel, according to that Goſpel-promiſe, <note place="margin">Pſal. 110.3.</note> 
                     <hi>From the womb of the morning thou haſt the dew of thy youth;</hi> that is, multitudes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be converted upon the firſt preaching of the Goſpel, which ſhould overſpread the earth, even as the morning dew; but in the age wherein God hath caſt us, the number of converts are greatly leſſend, and not only leſſened to what they were in former time, but to what they have been in our time; what numbers of the younger ſort of people did come in upon the preaching of the Word within theſe few yeers? but now how is the work of converſion at a great ſtand? heretofore Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters fiſhed as with a net, many were brought in; but now we fiſh as it were with an angle, now one comes in, and then another; this may be one probable demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that in part the Spirit of God is withdrawn from the Miniſtery of the Word.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another conjecture is this; when men that live under the Miniſtery of the Word grow worſe and worſe, and not better; for men to remaine many yeeres under the Miniſtery of the Word, and yet to be more blinde and more blockiſh, and more perverſel, and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, this argues that certainly the Spirit of God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from ſuch, and that their deſtruction is nigh; the ground which hath the raine often falling upon it, and yet is unfruitful, <note place="margin">Heb. 6.7.8.</note> 
                     <hi>is nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.) The Spirit being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, the raine of the Goſpel is a curſe to them, and the end of ſuch ſhall be burning.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You may feare the Spirit is withdrawn from the Miniſtery of the Word, becauſe there are more pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Errour, then converted by the Truth; for theſe laſt years eſpecially, ſince erroneous men have had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115133:17"/>and countenance. What multitudes have beene perverted and led away by the Errours of ungodly men? this is an argument of a judiciall hardneſſe upon the Land. How are we fallen into thoſe times of which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, wherein <hi>ſhall be falſe teachers, and ſuch who ſhall bring in damnable Hereſies, even deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction, and many ſhall follow their pernicious wayes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.1,2.</note> How many in theſe our dayes have been perverted, following the pernicious wayes of falſe teachers; which ſurely is an argument of the Spirits ſuſpenſion from the Miniſtery.</p>

Becauſe the Word of truth is ſo adulterated with Error; this may be a reaſon why the Word prevailes ſo little upon the hearts of men. As in a field where there are many weeds, the ſeed will never grow there; ſo where there are many Errours ſprung up in a Church, the ſeed of Gods Word will not thrive there. The increaſe of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Hereſies ſuſpends the working of Gods Spirit in the hearts of men. Chriſt, it is ſaid of him, <note place="margin">Mark 7.13.</note> that he <hi>taught the people with authority, and not as did the Scribes;</hi> and why not as did the Scribes? you have the reaſon given by Chriſt in the Evangeliſt Saint <hi>Marke;</hi> ſayes he, <hi>You make the Word of God of none effect through your tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which ye have delivered.</hi> It was of no force upon the conſciences of their followers; their erroneous tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions made the Word of God of none effect, even as thoſe erroneous opinions in our dayes; how do they ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe the glory and ſplendor of the Word of God, and hinder the Spirits working? Is not this the language of many.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115133:18"/>do not mixe, nor adulterate the Word, as Vintners do their wine; but ſaies he, by manifeſtation of the truth commend our ſelves to every mans conſcience in the ſight of God; the word in their mouths it was truly and powerfully preached, it reached even the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Demonſtr. </seg>5</label> Becauſe men deny the calling of the Miniſtery, this may he another reaſon why God ſuſpends his Spirits operation in it. God will not purſue the Miniſtery to ſuch with efficacy, who contemn and deny the Miniſtery. There are multitudes of men which do not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, our perſons, but the very Miniſtery it ſelf, who deny the Calling, and would beat down the Office; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is juſt with God that thoſe who will not believe the Office of the Miniſtery, that they ſhall not finde the efficacy of the Spirit in it. Hence the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the Theſſalonians, ſaies, <hi>Our Goſpel came not unto you in word onely, but alſo in power, and in the holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance, as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your ſakes;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1.5.</note> as if he ſhould ſay, you know our Office and Calling, and our manner of living, you believe it, and therefore the Goſpel comes to you, <hi>not in word</hi> but in <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> It is obſervable of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, that the reaſon why he wrought ſo much on the people, <hi>inſomuch that all</hi> Judah, <hi>and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions round about came out unto him;</hi> the reaſon was this, <note place="margin">Matth. 14.5.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe they did all hold</hi> John <hi>for a Prophet,</hi> the people did believe his Office; They all held that the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme of <hi>John</hi> was of Heaven, and not of man; and therefore for men to cry down the Office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, <note place="margin">Matt. 21.26,25.</note> and to deny it, this may render it ineffectual, and may provoke God to withhold his Spirit from accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of it.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>if the Spirit</hi> do not diſſwade thee, thou wilt be ready and apt to yeeld to any ſin thou art tempted unto.

When the winde blows with a freſh gale, the veſſell may ſaile againſt the ſtreame, which otherwiſe was to be carried down againſt the ſtreame; ſo is it with the gales of the Spirit, they help a man to overcome the ſtreame both of temptation and corruption too; but when the Spirit is withdrawn, then how venturous will a man be to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſinne?</p>
                  <p>If thou art left of the Spirit, thou wilt not only be apt and ready to yeeld unto ſinful temptations, but thou wilt ſuddenly and eagerly commit ſinne.

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. When the Spirit is withdrawn, they not onely give themſelves, but they give themſelves over to laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; that is, they give themſelves not partially, but totally unto the wayes of ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is ſaid <hi>they give themſelves,</hi> and this was worſe then <hi>Ahabs</hi> fact, <note place="margin">1 King. 21.25.</note> for he ſold himſelf to work wickedneſſe; now for a man to ſell himſelf to the Devill, it is a great evill; but when a man ſhall give himſelf, and give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf over, this is a farre greater wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Here was not only a giving themſelves over to ſin in thought, but the text ſaith, they gave themſelves over to work uncleanneſſe, they contented not themſelves with contemplative wickedneſſe, but they were workers of iniquity, ſuch as made a trade of ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is ſaid they gave themſelves over <hi>to all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> not only to ſome ſinnes, but to all ſinnes, and that with greedineſſe; which is to my purpoſe, Whither will that man runne whom the evill ſpirit drives? if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God doth not come in with contrary motions to the Devils motions, with what a vehement eagerneſſe will a poor man damn his own ſoul, ſuch a man will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtay till he comes to Hell, if the Spirit of God do not ſtop him in his careere, and ſay to him, <hi>this is the way, walk in it;</hi> but when the Spirit withdrawes, every man turnes to his courſe as the horſe into the battle, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6.—and how violently will a horſe runne into the battle that is not reſtrained with bit and bridle—<hi>Pſalm</hi> 32.9. ſo is the man that hath neither checks

                  <p n="3">Thirdly, A man being left of the Spirit of God when he is tempted unto ſinne, will not onely fall into it aptly, ſuddenly and eagerly, but alſo with complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and this is worſt of all; ſo we reade of <hi>thoſe that received not the truth in the love of it, that they took plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in unrighteouſneſſe;</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe otherwiſe thou wilt never be convinced of the evill thou haſt done, <note place="margin">John 16.8.</note> 
                     <hi>it is the Spirit which convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the world of ſin;</hi> without the Spirits conviction there is no conviction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou canſt never repent of ſinne if the Spirit do not after its commiſſion rebuke and convince thee, for the Spirits conviction precedes repentance, therefore ſaies the Prophet, <hi>no man repents him of his wickedneſſe, ſaying, what have I done;</hi>

We have a proverb amongſt us, that <hi>what the eye ſees not, the heart grieves not for,</hi> ſo if the eye of the ſoul ſees not ſinne, the heart will never be troubled for ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thou canſt never have thy nature ſanctified from the filth of ſin, unleſſe the Spirit work on thee after thy falling into ſin; ſanctification it is by the Spirit of God: And therfore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the Corinthians, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wicked and unregenerate men, ſaies, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.11,</note> 
                     <hi>ſuch were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>

                     </label> In the general, you are to know that God doth it not as an act of Sovereignty, but as an act of Juſtice; you wrong the Spirit, and therefore God withholds the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.—There may be five reaſons laid down as the ground why God withholds his Spirit in its ſtrivings with men.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe in times paſt you have refuſed to hearken to the frequent motions and perſwaſions of Gods Spirit; the Spirit of God hath told you that if you walk in ſuch wicked wayes, <hi>the end of them will be death;</hi> how often hath it ſuggeſted unto you, that if you go on in ſuch and ſuch courſes, you will be undone for ever? and yet you have gone on in ſinne, and would not hearken unto the Spirit; thus God complaines of his people by the Pſalmiſt, <note place="margin">Pſal. 81.11,12</note> 
                     <hi>My people would not hearken &amp; my voice, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>would have none of me; ſo I gave them up unto their own hearts luſt, and they walked in their own counſels;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, they would not hearken unto me, and 
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115133:21"/>therefore my Spirit ſhall diſſwade them no more. I will leave them to themſelves, and let them take their own courſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe it may be you have faſtened, and fathered ſinful affections that ariſe from the fleſh, upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits motions, and this is ſuch an injury to the Spirit that he will not bear, as when men ſhall ſay their wrath kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from hell, is the zeale of the Spirit coming down from Heaven; that their erroneous opinions are the Spirits teachings, when he is the Spirit of truth; and Satanical deluſions, divine inſpirations. And this is an indignity not inferiour, then if ſome ſubject ſhould lay his baſtard at his Princes gate; and this ſome think is underſtood by the vexing of the Spirit mentioned by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 63.10.</note> this may be another cauſe why the Lord may withhold his Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe men do more eaſily liſten to the ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the evill Spirit, then to the motions of the good Spirit; it makes your friend deny to come to your houſe when you ſhall give entertainment to his enemy, when the Devill ſhall come and eaſily prevaile with you, when you ſhall either ſinne upon no temptation, or upon a ſmal temptation; this is a high provocation to Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and this is a reaſon why there is ſo ſevere a judgment annexed to the third Commandment; that God will not hold them guiltleſſe that take his name in vaine, becauſe there is leſſe temptation to the ſinne of ſwearing then to any other ſinne in the world. Other ſinnes they are more conſonant to fleſh and blood, but ſwearing of all ſinnes, men have the leaſt temptation to it; The ſwearer ſerves the Devill <hi>gratis,</hi> and hath neither profit nor pleaſure by his ſinne, and therefore God annexes ſo ſevere a puniſhment. When thou ſhalt runne unto ſinne upon an eaſie t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mptation, and wilt not hearken to Gods Spirit upon an earneſt motion, this provokes the Lord to withhold the ſtrivings of his Spirit from thee.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe in former time thou haſt plotted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115133:22"/>how to commit ſinne, therefore the Spirit will withdraw from thee for time to come. There are many that do commit ſinne with deliberation, premeditation, and conſultation; and that man which commits a ſinne deliberately and contrivedly, he doth greatly provoke the Spirit of God. <note place="margin">Pro. v 16.30.</note> It is ſaid of a wicked man that he ſhutteth his eyes to deviſe miſchief; ſhutting of the eye is a ſtudying, plotting and deliberating poſture. As it is with a friend, if you ſhall give him a blow at perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, though he may be angry at firſt, yet when he ſhall underſtand that it was againſt your will, he will be quickly pacified, but if he ſees that you plot and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive his death, this makes him that he will never come into your company more: Thus it is with the Spirit of God, when he ſees thee fall into ſinne inconſiderately and unadviſedly, he will not withdraw from thee for this; but when the Spirit ſhall ſee that we way-lay him, and do deliberate and contrive how to commit ſin, this provokes him, if not for ever, yet for a long departure. Such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate acts of the ſoul they are more directly againſt God; <note place="margin">1 King. 15.5.</note> and to this purpoſe is obſervable what you reade concerning <hi>David, that he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord all the dayes of his life, ſave onely in the matter of</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah <hi>the Hittite.</hi> Now why doth not the text ſay rather, that he was perfect, or did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, ſave onely in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> for that was the fouleſt ſinne? There is this reaſon given hereof, why the Spirit of God ſhould ſay that he was a <hi>perfect man, ſave onely in the matter of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> rather then in that of <hi>Bathſheba;</hi> becauſe his ſinne in the matter of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> it was done raſhly and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately, he was ſuddenly ſurprized with a temptation; but the <hi>matter of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. ch. 11.</note> it was done more deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, plottingly and contrivedly; for firſt, he ſends for him home from the warres, that ſo he might cloak his foul fact, then he makes him drunk, and after he makes him carry the contrivance of his own death in a letter
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115133:22"/>to <hi>Joab;</hi> ſo that it was a ſinne ſo deliberately acted, that the Spirit of God put a brand upon him for it; take heed therefore of deliberate acts of ſinne. I cenſure none, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of you muſt ſtand or fall to your own Maſter; but this I ſay, that it is a ſinne which gives an eſpecial provocation to the Spirit of God. It is the ſaying of a Modern Divine, and a true one; That a deliberate will to ſinne without the act, is more ſinful then the act of ſinne without a deliberate will; and thus in the caſe of <hi>Peter,</hi> that man does worſe who purpoſes to deny Chriſt, though he never doth it, then <hi>Peter</hi> that did actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſt, and never intended it; therefore look to your purpoſes and deliberations; if you ſinne deliberately, it is the next ſtep to the ſinne of thoſe againſt whom the Prophet prayes, Lord, be not merciful to thoſe that ſinne maliciouſly.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Spirit of God will withdraw from a man when men proſtitute the holy Spirit to baſe luſts, as all hypocrites do who do talk of the Spirit onely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſinne, and enjoy their luſts more ſecurely.

A godly man may be ſo farre left by the Spirit, that when he is tempted to a ſinne, he may rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with fleſh and blood then with the Spirit of God, whether he ſhould commit the ſinne, yea or no: And thus a godly man, when life, liberty and eſtate lie at ſtake, doth often conſult his own ſafety rather then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace; and this is very much, <note place="margin">2.

                  <p n="4">4. Godly men may be ſo left, that they may contrive and deliberate how to commit a ſinne before they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it.

                  <p>You finde alſo of <hi>Noah,</hi> that in the Scripture he is commended for a very ſober man, and that when all the world were eating and drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage, it was a very drunken exceſſive and luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous age; and <hi>Noah</hi> he was commended by God for his ſobriety; <note place="margin">Gen. 9.21.</note> but yet through drunkenneſſe was the ſinne moſt contrary to that excellent grace of ſobriety he was ſo eminent in, yet was he overtaken therewith.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe <hi>Lot,</hi> he is commended by the holy Ghoſt for diſliking the filthy converſation of the Sodomites, and it is ſtrange that <hi>Lot</hi> himſelf ſhould be overtaken with the ſinne of uncleanneſſe, and that he ſhould fall into the abominable ſinne of Inceſt; for ſo you finde it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated of him, <note place="margin">Gen. 19.33,35.</note>

                  <p n="1">1. By working in thee a more clear conviction of ſinne, to ſhew thee not ſin in the lump, but thy particular ſinne, clothed with all its haynous and agravating circumſtances; to convince thee ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there may be (as it were) ſome compenſation made of the Spirits being before whithheld from thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In a more deep humiliation, the more the Spirit hath been withheld from you before the commiſſion of ſinne, deſire that the more the Spirit may caſt thee down after its commiſſion. This was typed out under the Law; that man which did but touch <hi>an unclean thing, was to be unclean till evening;</hi> but if a man had carried an unclean thing about him, then he was to caſt off all his clothes: So if you have but touched a ſinne, you are to be humbled; but if you have fallen into a ſinne which the Spirit hath not convinced you of, then you are to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for a greater meaſure of conviction and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation afterwards.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Learn that the Spirit may work in thee a more dear affection to Jeſus Chriſt. It is obſerved of <hi>Peter,</hi> the Spirit did more leave him to fall into ſinne then he did all the other Apoſtles, except <hi>Judas;</hi> Now, when Chriſt comes to aske <hi>Peter</hi> whether he loved himor not? ſaies he, <hi>Simon Peter, doeſt thou love me more then theſe?</hi> He doth not ſay onely doeſt thou love me, <hi>Peter, but loveſt thou me more then theſe?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Peter,</hi> thou haſt ſinned againſt me more then all the other Apoſtles have, and therefore thou ſhouldeſt love me more then they.

                     <hi>Her ſinnes which are many, are forgiven her, for ſhe loved much;</hi> that is, the leſſe love ſhe had to Jeſus Chriſt before the commiſſion of ſinne, the more ſhe had afterwards, <hi>Many ſinnes were forgiven her, and therefore ſhe loved much; therefore</hi> in that place muſt not be underſtood as if her love was a cauſe of her being forgiven, but a demonſtration and an evidence of it.</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115133:28"/>Spirit, when the Spirit of God ſhall back the teſtimony of thy conſcience, to evidence the ſincerity of thy heart; and thus you read of <hi>Paul, that his conſcience did beare him witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt; the Spirit of God</hi> did wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with his ſpirit the truth and ſincerity of his heart.<note place="margin">Rom. 9.1. 2 Cor. 1.12.</note>—Now though I might handle all theſe particulars, and ſhew what a grievous judgement it is to have the Spirit withheld in theſe regards: Yet I ſhall onely ſpeak of the Spirit, and ſhew what a ſad judgement it is to have the Spirit withheld in its exciting acts, that it ſhall not ſtir up holy motions in the heart to good; in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of which I ſhall proceed after this method. 
<list>

                        <item>2. When the Spirit doth vouchſafe ſuch motions; how you may know them, and difference them from thoſe motions to good which the Devil may ſtir a man up unto.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That man from whom the Spirit is withheld in its motions unto good, there are theſe three miſeries which will attend him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There will be a vacuity or emptineſſe of holy thoughts in thy heart. The Spirit of God is like unto the ſpring in the Clock, if that lie ſtill, all lies ſtill; ſo if the Spirit of God lies ſtill within thee, <note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> all thy affections which are the motions of thy ſoul, they cannot ſtirre. <hi>It is God which worketh in us both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> If the Spirit of God be withheld, there cannot be ſo much as a will in thee to that which is truly good. Mans heart it is like that houſe in the Parable, <note place="margin">Matth. 12.44.</note> (when the Spirit is withheld from him) when the Devil came to poſſeſſe it, it is ſaid that <hi>he found it empty, ſwept and garniſhed;</hi> empty, that is, void of any holy thoughts, and gracious motions; and garniſhed, that is, not with the graces of Gods Spirit, but with the Devils furniture; and if you will ſee what that furniture is, read <hi>Matth.</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:115133:28"/>15.19,20. There will be an emptineſſe in thy heart of good motions, when God withdrawes his Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thy heart will he filled and peſtered with evill motions from the Devill. Mans heart it cannot lie long idle or empty; if it be not filled withe the Spirits motions, it will be by the Devils inſtigations. The heart if it be not <hi>Chriſts garden,</hi> it will be the Devils <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary;</hi> if not Chriſts <hi>ſtore-houſe,</hi> it will be the Devils work-houſe; if it be not the Temple of the holy Ghoſt, it will be the Devils Chappel. Now this is that which makes the miſery the greater when evill motions do pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and fill the heart; the Sripture expreſſes it by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils filling of the heart. If the gales of the holy Spirit do not fill the ſailes of thy heart to ſet thee forward to heaven, then the inſtigation and provocations of Satan will help to drive thee forward to hell; <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.18. 1 John 4.13.</note> and it is worth your noting, as the Scripture ſpeaks of the <hi>indwelling of the Spirit,</hi> that is, by its motions in the hearts of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as we ſay the Sunne is in the houſe, when only the beames thereof are there: So when evill motions ſhall fill our hearts, the Scripture expreſſes this by the Devils being there; thus the Apoſtle to <hi>Ananians, Why hath Satan filled thy heart?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 5.3.</note> it is not to be underſtood of a bodily poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, but the meaning is that the Devil put that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous motion into his heart; the Devill was in that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was in his heart; and therefore men are to look upon evill motions, as having the Devill in them. When <hi>Judas</hi> had a motion to betray Chriſt, it's ſaid, <note place="margin">Luke 22.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Then entered Satan into him;</hi> the Devill entered with that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for immediately he went out and communed with the high Prieſts, and came to an agreement with them about the betraying of Chriſt, and they muſt needs go whom the Devill drives, as we ſay in the Proverb. What a miſery then is this? when the Spirit of God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in its gracious motions, then will the Devill poſſeſſe thy heart by evill motions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the Spirit withdraw in its exciting acts, it will 
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115133:29"/>alſo be withheld in its aſſiſting acts, this is a farther miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; if it never move you to act grace, it will never aſſiſt you therein. It is true, that ſometimes there may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to good in the heart which may not be backt with aſſiſtance. The reſolutions that many take to become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, are the common workings of the Spirit, which many times are never brought into act by any farther aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Spirit; as ſometimes convictions are without converſion. But this is certain, that where the Spirit moves not to good, it will not aſſiſt in the doing thereof; water can riſe no higher then the ſpring from whence it flows; if thy motions are natural, there will be no more aſſiſtance then what comes from nature.</p>
                  <p n="1">Now we may know the miſery of the Spirits with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing his exciting and aſſiſting power by the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars following, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Upon this withdrawing the ſoul is not ſo voluntarily put upon doing good, nor doth it ſet upon holy duties with ſo much liking delight and complacency, but rather doth them in a compulſory way, and we come to them as a Bear to the ſtake, or as a childe ſent to ſchoole.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor with ſo much frequency; once ſeven times a day with <hi>David,</hi> or three times a day with <hi>Daniel;</hi> now not ſeven times in a moneth, nor thrice aweek.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor with ſo much fervency, nor with ſuch warme working affections, as formerly; but men are lazie, luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme, liſtleſſe, and liveleſſe in all holy exerciſes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nor is there ſuch conſiſtency of holy motions, but they are gliding, tranſient and fleeting; not fixt, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding upon the heart.</p>
                  <p>But how may a man know the difference between the Spirits exciting to good, and the Devils motions in the heart to do good?—This is a practical and uſeful caſe, becauſe it is poſſible, yea common, that the Devill will move men to do good; the Devill in this caſe doth ſometimes appear as an Angel of light; therefore to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Queſtion, I ſhall lay down ſeveral particulars.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:115133:29"/>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> who had no call ſo to do. And as it is thus in Divine, ſo alſo in Political affairs; as for a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man to do the work of a Magiſtrate; it being out of his place and calling, it is from the devil, not from God. <hi>Abſolom</hi> undertakes to ſhew juſtice to the people, but what this? he was but an uſurper of the royal office; and as he had no right to the regal power, neither had he any call to adminiſter pulick juſtice. For private men upon a pretence of being gifted, to take upon them the publick Miniſtery, it cannot be from the Spirit of God; for the Spirit keeps men within their bounds: therefore ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>Let every man wherein he is called, abide therein with God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.20,24.</note> The Spirit it puts men upon the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good in their place and calling, but the devil doth not. As fire in the Chimney, it is good, and is put there by your ſevants; but fire put in the roofe or rafters of your houſe, that is done by an enemy. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to good in your place and calling, they come from the Spirit of God, but motions to good out
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115133:30"/>of your calling are ſuggeſted by the devil.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The devil he may move you to good, but then it may be it is, that he may hinder you in the doing of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good. It is very obſervable, when our Saviour began to ſhew his Diſciples, <note place="margin">Mat. 16.21,22,23.</note> 
                     <hi>how that he muſt go unto</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and ſuffer many things of the Elders, the chief Prieſts, and the Scribes, and be killed, and be raiſed again the third day: That</hi> Peter <hi>took him and began to rebuke him ſaying, Be it far from thee Lord, this ſhall not be unto thee.</hi> Now this came from the devil, that he might hinder the work of mans ſalvation; and therefore ſayes Chriſt, <hi>Get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde me, Satan, thou art an offence unto me; for thou ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureſt not the things that be of God, but thoſe that be of men.</hi> There is much of Gods minde in theſe words. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Papiſts who pretend a fu ceſſion from <hi>Peter,</hi> they would excuſe <hi>Peter</hi> in this motion, and would make it a divine motion: But Proteſtants do generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in this, that <hi>Peters</hi> motion was naturally good, he ſhewed in it a natural love to Chriſt, but yet the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil was in it too, and therefore Chriſt calls him Satan, <hi>Get thee behinde me, Satan;</hi> and then, <hi>Thou art an offence to me</hi> in that thou ſhouldeſt make ſuch a motion, to hinder me from going on to work out and accompliſh the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of my people; and then it could not be from the Spirit; for, ſayes he, <hi>Thou ſavoureſt not the things that be of God, but thoſe that are of man.</hi> At the firſt view you would deeme this a very loving motion, but the devil had a finger in it, he will move you to do good, ſo it may hinder you in the performance of a greater good. But the Spirit of God will ſo move you to the doing of one good thing, that it ſhall not juſtle out the performance of another.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The devil when he moves men to do good, it is to make them do it unſeaſonably, on p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rpoſe that one duty may juſtle out another; as ſuppoſe thou wouldeſt pray, and happily the devil he cannot diſtract thee by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thoughts, yet he will labour to do it by good thoughts
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115133:30"/>unſeaſonably remembred, as if thou art praying to have thy thoughts then taken up with what Sermons thou haſt heard, and of what parts of the Bible thou haſt read, this though in it ſelfe it is good, yet it comes from the devil; and therefore thoſe that now come to our aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and will preſently fall upon private prayer in the time of publick worſhip, though the duty in it ſelf is good, yet it is unſeaſonably done and comes not from the holy Spirit, the God of order. There are ſeveral inſtances hereof. That man which came to Chriſt and deſired him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the inheritance between him and his brother; <note place="margin">Luke 12.13.</note> the motion though it was good, yet it was unſeaſonably made, becauſe it was when Chriſt was preaching; and therefore though good, yet it came from the devil that he might hinder a greater good. And thus thoſe people, <hi>When will the new Moone be over, that we may ſell corne? and the Sabbath, that we may ſet forth wheate?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Amos 8.5.</note> It was no evil thing to ſell wheat, but the motion was unſeaſonable, becauſe it was upon the Sabbath day. Good motions in ſeaſon they are a bleſſing, <note place="margin">Deut. 28.12.</note> 
                     <hi>even as rain in a dry</hi> ſeaſon is a comfort; but raine in harveſt is not ſo. Good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons coming into a mans minde unſeaſonably, as when a man is praying, then to think of what he hath heard in a Sermon; and when a man is hearing, then to think of praying, theſe come from the evil, not the good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; as a Printer though his paper be good, and his letter faire, yet if he miſplace his letter, and put one letter for another he will make non-ſenſe: Even ſo are good thoughts out of ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When a man is moved ſo to do good, that the performance of it is a prejudice to bodily health; this comes not from Gods holy Spirit, but from the evil ſpirit. And herein young converts are very injudicious, at firſt they have ſtrong affections, and they think they muſt read ſo many Chapters, pray ſo many houres, and hear ſo many Sermons, otherwiſe their conſciences check them, and they think that all this comes from
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115133:31"/>God, whereas rather they are put upon it by the impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their own ſpirit. If thou art ſtrongly moved to a duty, and ſo moved to it that either the continuance or frequency in it doth impaire the ſtrength of nature, this is not commanded by God; for God had rather have mercy then ſacrifice in ſuch a caſe, God is not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and cruel in commanding of duty. The Jews learnt of God to ſacrifice; their beaſts but they learnt of the devil to ſacrifice their children. God requires not that you ſhould faſt ſo often, and do duty ſo long, as to weaken health and ſtrength; he hath made no duty for the ſoul to be prejudicial to the body. <hi>God will have mercy, and not ſacrifice. Hoſea</hi> 6.6. God deals with young converts as <hi>Jacob</hi> did with the children and flocks, he will not out-drive them. Indeed it is the devils Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to put men upon ſuch ſervices as are cruel to their own bodies, and thus the worſhippers of <hi>Baal they cut themſelves, till the blood guſhed out upon them;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Kin. 18.28.</note> they were cruel to their own bodies, whereas the Lord never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded any ſuch thing at their hands.—I mention not this, that it may be a plea for any one to pamper their bodies, or that they ſhould be negligent in the ſervice of God; but for the ſake of young converts, who think they can never do enough in duty, who do more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God required at their hands.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Motions from the devil to good, they are uſually when they may hinder, and cauſe a man to neglect his outward and neceſſary calling; this young converts are greatly faulty in; their endeavours are ſuch, and their proſecutions ſo earneſt to live holily, that they live idly. God did never ſo order Religion that it ſhould be a diſadvantage to our particular callings in the world. He is a good Chriſtian that knows how to pray, and hear, and how to labour in his calling too. I know that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affaires and imployments, they robbe the ſoul of much time in that duty it ows to God. I plead not at all for this, but this is that which I would preſſe: I would
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115133:31"/>neither have your particular callings rob time from your general callings and duties as Chriſtians, nor your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall callings rob time from your particular callings as men, who are to live here in the world. This was a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion grown upon the firſt plantation of the Church; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells you of <hi>ſome, who walked diſorderly, and did not worke at all.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3.11.</note> Some imagine that under this pretence they would not follow a calling, becauſe they would wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote themſelves to the ſervice of God; of theſe the Apoſtle ſpeakes, and ſuch are they who lead a Monaſterial life, under a pretence to be more at leaſure to ſerve God, when indeed they but put their candle under a buſhel, and hide their talent in a napkin. This comes from the Devil, and not from God; for God never ordained that his ſervice ſhould make you negligent in your outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; but hath commanded that <hi>with quietneſs you work, and eat your own bread.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3.12. 1 Tim. 5.8.</note> I ſpeak not this to make men worldly, and that they ſhould glut themſelves with worldly buſineſs. It is the fault of many, that they graſp too much worldly buſineſs, and are to their ſouls worſe then Egyptian task-maſters; but let not men rob time from God, and give it to the world; but I ſpeak this for the ſake of young converts, who will be every day faſting, and every day hearing, and in the mean time neglect their outward and neceſſary callings in the world.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Motions to good come from the Divel, in caſe our motions of duty to God make us neglect our duty to man. A notable text you have for this out of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt <hi>Matthew;</hi> the Scribes and Phariſees had taught this Doctrine, that if any man had been free and liberal in giving towards pious uſes, he ſhould be free from thoſe duties which he owed to his father and mother, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay they, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſay to his father or his mother, It is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> gift, by whatſoever thou mighteſt be profited by me, and honour not his father or his mother, he ſhall be free.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 15.5,6.</note> This the Scripture condemnes for hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, when men out of a pretence of duty to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115133:32"/>God, ſhall neglect their duty to men, &amp; therefore it comes from the Divel. The Spirit of God when it moves men to duty, it moves them with an equal motion, as wel duties to man, <note place="margin">Mich. 6.7.</note> as duties to God, duties of the ſecond, as wel as of the firſt table; unto duties of charity &amp; equity, as wel as of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards God, if a man be never ſo pious towards God, and yet is neglective of his duty to man, this man is not led by the Spirit of God, for that leads a man to one duty as well as the other. A boat that's made onely by one oare on one ſide, will not go right, no more will a man go right to Heaven that is partial in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. When the Devil moves you to do good, he ſo moves you to be eager in the doing of it, <note place="margin">Gal. 5.4. compared with Verſe 8.</note> that you may depend on the good you do. To this purpoſe ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Whoſoever of you are juſtified by workes, ye are faln from grace;</hi> whoſoever ſhal depend upon the works he doth for juſtification, is not led thereunto by the Spirit of God; and therfore it followeth (ſaith he) <hi>This perſwaſion cometh not of him that calleth you,</hi> it cometh not from God; for the Spirit of God it quells and keeps down the thought of merit. In former times (though I could not contemne works of mercy, but wiſh there were more of them in this iron age of the world, when moſt men are guilty of hard-hearted uncharitableneſs.) What was the reaſon that men Popiſhly affected have left ſuch monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their liberality behinde them, doing many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table works of mercy. but only hope of merit by them? a worke of mercy it is good in it ſelf, but to be moved to it upon a hope of merit, this comes from the Devil, not from God.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. When the Devil ſhall put thee upon the doing of good at that time, which is not thy own time. As ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the life of any neer in relation unto t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115133:32"/>thing is moſt beautiful in its ſeaſon. Again, for ſervants when they are about their Maſters buſineſs, when the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of thy Maſter lies upon thy diligence, and thou ſhalt then have a motion to pray, or a motion to hear, and ſo fall upon the exerciſe of Religious duties, ſo as to neglect thy Maſters buſineſs; this is a ſin, and comes from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. And the reaſon is this, becauſe God looks upon ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, their perſons and their time, as none of their own, and thou ſhalt at ſuch time pleaſe God more in the doing of thy Maſters buſineſs then if thou wert on thyknees at thy prayers.—Now I do not mention this to make men ſevere towards their ſervants, as to allow them more time for God and their ſouls; nor to quench any good motions which ſhall be in them to good, as many wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and worldly Maſters do to their godly ſervants; but this is that I could adviſe them, that they ſhould not take time for holy duties from their neceſſary buſineſs, whereby their Maſters may be prejudiced, but rather from their ſleep, and thoſe vacant houres which are allowed them.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. when you ſhall be moved to do a good thing which is above your growth, ann too high, and too hard for you, this motion comes not from the Spirit of God. When women and young men, whoſe educations do not require it, ſhall dive into queſtions, and darke controverſies in Religion, God requires not this at their hands, but rather that they ſhould ſtudy and follow plain ſundamental points. Chriſt he would not put his young diſciples upon duties above their ſtrength and growth, <note place="margin">Mat. 9.16,17</note> and young and weak Chriſtians they ſhould not put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the doing of thoſe things which are too hard for them, and which God never commanded them; you have an excellent rule for this in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.1. <hi>Lord, my heart is not hau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="10">10. The Devil will put men upon the doing of that 
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115133:33"/>which is good, that ſo he may the ſooner tire and weary them out in the wayes of Religion; and this is a great policy of the Divel, and hereupon the Divel will make a young convert at firſt converſion pray more in one day then in a moneth of after-time; and though there is much of God in theſe young affections, yet there is much ſin mingled with them too.—The divel hath a twofold end to make young converts do good.—Firſt, either to make them the ſooner weary of Religion; or elſe ſecondly, to make wicked men think the more hardly of Religion.—I do not mention this to quench and ſtifle good motions in any, I know where there is one man over-does, there are ten thouſand which do too little. But we muſt take heed leſt like the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> we be not too ſevere; for as they by too much auſterity had like to have ſwallowed up the penitent excommunicate perſon with too much grief: ſo the rigorous and over-much ſtrictneſs will diſcourage them from the wayes of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Motions to good come from the Divel, in caſe thou art moved to thoſe things which are ſubſervien and introductory to duty rather then to the duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion themſelves. This is a great ſubtilty of the Devil, if he can keep men in the porch, they ſhall never come into the Temple. As conſideration it is apreparatory duty to prayer, meditation to hearing, and examination to the duty of receiving the Lords Supper; now if the Divel can keep thee ſo long in theſe preparitory duties, that thou canſt take no time for the maine duties themſelves, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Divel hath his end. Chriſtians are oftentimes very inconſiderate in this caſe; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile </seg>1</label> it is juſt as if a man ſhould have an houres time allotted him to play a melodious leſſon to a company, and he ſpends all his time in tuning his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument: Thus it is with many Chriſtians, the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for duty is only in order to the furtherance of us in holy duty; he that is ſo long in preparation, as he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects duty, deſtroyes the very end of preparation. I know there are ſome which never uſe preparation to duty, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115133:33"/>others there are who by the ſubtilty of the Divel in their preparations, rob themſelves of much time which they ought to imploy in the maine duties themſelves; but the Spirit of God doth ſo gird up the loyns of our mind, <note place="margin">1 Per. 1.13.</note> that it makes us ſuccinct in the diſpatch of his duties.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Motions to good come from the Divel, in caſe thou art moved to it, that ſo it may be a cloak to thee to do wickedly with the leſs ſuſpition, and with the more boldneſs. Thus it was with <hi>Abſolom,</hi> it was a good thing in him that he would do juſtice to all the people, and when they came for juſtice to his father, he would ſpeak friendly to them and kiſs them; <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.3,4.</note> but all this was meerly in a pretence, that ſo they might not entertain the ſuſpition of his uſurping his fathers Kingdome. And ſo alſo the Scribes and Phariſees, they devoured widows houſes, and for a pretence made long prayers. <note place="margin">Mat. 23.14.</note> It was good to make long prayers, but to do it for ſo wicked an end was moſt abominable. So that if a mans motions to good be for this end, that he may ſin with more freedome and leſs ſuſpition, they come from the Divel, not from God. The Devil cares not how good you ſeem, ſo you may but be really evil and ſinful.</p>

                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:115133:34"/>There are three ſorts of ſpiritual deſertions. 
<list>
                        <item>1. Cautional, for preventing of ſin; ſo was <hi>Paul</hi> buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Satan, leſt he ſhould be exalted above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.7.</note>

                        <item>2. Probational, for trial and exerciſe of grace; and thus it was with holy <hi>Job.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. Penal and caſtigatory, for chaſtiſement of ſpiritual ſloth; and ſo in the example of the Spouſe before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe men are more ready to entertaine evil mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſin, then the Spirits motions to good. This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon. When a friend ſhall ſee that an old acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance will rather hearken to the ſolicitations of an enemy then himſelf, this will provoke him to break off intimacy with him; thus the Spirit of God which hath been thy old friend, &amp; thy beſt friend, when he ſhall ſee thee hearken to the ſuggeſtions of the evil ſpirit, rather then to his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, this provokes him to a departure. I may accommodate the Hiſtory of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to this purpoſe.—When the grave &amp; ſage Ancients of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaw that that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate King had forſaken their advice, and did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the raw and raſh advice of a company of green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed young men; they left him, and ten parts of twelve fell from him: even ſo doth the holy Spirit leave them that do ſlight his motions and ſaving coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe men have abuſed the motions and workings of the Spirit to baſe and ſinful ends; as for popular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, vaine glory, ſecret advantage, for a cloak to hide ſome ſecret luſt; when the Spirit of God in its workings is made ſo ill an uſe of, as to be made an excuſe for a mans luſts, this provokes the Spirit of God to leave a man to proſtitute ſpiritual gifts to baſe imployments! What is this but for a man to light his Lanthorne at the Lamp of the Sanctuary, that he may ſee to ſteal by it? And this was the ſin of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Acts 8.19.</note> he would faine with money have bought the gift of the Spirit, that ſo he might have
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115133:35"/>proſtituted it to an ill uſe. This is a high provocation to the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe men have fathered, and faſtned thoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful affections, which proceed from the fleſh, upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; when men ſhall accompt their own wrath kindled from hell, to be the zeal of the Spirit coming from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; Satans deluſions the Spirits motions; licentious living, a Chriſtians Spiritual liberty; erroneous opinions, the Spirits teaching; when men ſhall intitle a preſumptuous peace the Spirits teſtimony, this is as if an adulterous begger ſhould lay his brat at the Kings door, this is ſuch a high provocation that the Spirit of God cannot but withdraw from ſuch.</p>
                  <p>I now come to lay down the Symptom's or ſignes of the Spirits withdrawings; and when I mention a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of the Spirit, I do not mean a total, but a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual with-drawing; and there are ten ſymptomes I ſhall lay down, any of which if you ſinde, you may be able to paſs a righteous ſentence upon your ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the Spirit be with-drawn, thou ſetteſt not upon the doing of good ſo voluntarily as thou haſt done in former time. Thy ſoul in former time did run ſwiftly and freely in away of goodnes, but now the wheels of the chariot of thy ſoul are taken oaff, nd thou driveſt on heavily; it is not the Chariot of <hi>Amminadab.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Neither ſo preparedly as thon waſt wont to do.

The ſoul was wont to trimme her ſelf as a bride when ſhe went into the King to injoy communion with the great God, but now is grown careleſſe in this preparation, it is a ſigne the Spirit is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thou haſt not ſo much complacency of heart in holy duties as formerly. Thoſe duties which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have been done as a delight, are now as a task; formerly they were as ſweet as honey to thy taſte, but now thou findeſt no more reliſh in them then in the white of an egge; time was when thou couldeſt ſay with the <hi>Pſalmist, I was glad when they ſaid, Come and let us go up unto the houſe of the Lord,</hi>

Diſtractions break in, and wandring thoughts go out; holy motions they are declining and tranſient, when they have not ſuch a fixed abiding on the heart as formerly; this is a ſigne of a gradual departure of the Spirit.

                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:115133:37"/>2. If thou committeſt more ſinnes in the doing of duty; as if there be more ſpiritual pride, more carnal dependance, more ſelfe-ends, more wandring thoughts, more irreverence of God, more hardneſſe of heart, and wearineſſe of ſpirit in holy exerciſes, this ſhews the abundance of ſinne in thee, and is an argument of the Spirits withdrawing. I appeale to your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, judge your ſelves, whether ſome, or all of theſe ſymptoms may not be found in you, and whether this in particular that thou doeſt duty leſs ſpiritually then formerly? thou haſt more ſinnes, and leſſe grace exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in it. I may illuſtrate this by a Simile. You never ſee a crow pitch upon a living man, but if the man be dead, and lie in a ditch, then how will every bird of prey faſten on him? You never ſee wormes creep upon a living man, but let him be once dead, and his ſoul once departed, how ſoone will wormes and vermine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure his carcaſe? I only accomodate this Simile to this end: That what the ſoul is to the body, that is the Spirit of God to the ſoul; while the ſoul is with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, a crow, or a bird of prey will not faſten on it; whileſt the Spirit of God quickens thee, vermine-luſts will not ſeize upon thee; but if once the Spirit of God which is the life of thy ſoul be withdrawn, then what ſwarmes of vermine-luſts will faſten on thy heart in all the dnties thou performeſt to God? what a cage of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean birds, what a receptacle of devils will thy heart be, if the Spirit of God be but once with-drawn from thee?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Thou mayeſt know if the Spirit be withdrawn by this; if thou ſetteſt not upon duty ſo carefully and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently as thou haſt done in former time, thou doſt with more negligence ſet upon the performance of duties, ruſh hand over head (as we ſay) upon it.—When the Spirit of God is withdrawn from a ſoul, it wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> grow careleſſe in holy duties, in two reſpects. 1. thou wilt be careleſs of the manner how thou doſt it, and never take care how
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115133:37"/>to make thy Spirit meet for its performance.—And then ſecondly, thou wilt never take care for the end of duty, that thy ſoul may be bettered by it, and thou made more meet for the enjoyment of God.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. If the Spirit be withdrawn thou mayeſt know it by this, that thou continueſt not in the uſe of duty, ſo practically, and influencially, as in former time; the meaning of this is in ſuch a caſe. Good duties done have not ſuch an influence to the bettering of our converſation. God never ordained duties for themſelves, that you might reſt in them, but for other ends, <note place="margin">Gal. 5.25.</note> in order to your lives and converſations, therefore ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>If we live in the Spirit, let us alſo walk in the Spirit.</hi> Thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wherein the Spirit aſſiſts us ſhould have an influence upon our lives; thou therefore which art conſtant in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties, and thoſe duties have no influence upon thy heart, thou art a great hearer, but not a godly liver, a great profeſſor, but thy practice doth not hold-level with thy profeſſion, this is an argument that thy duties do not carry a ſaving influence unto thy life; thou canſt pray well, but thou doeſt not live well; thou art a good man upon thy knee, but a bad man in thy trade, this is an argument that the Spirit of God is withdrawn from thee. Now look over your hearts and examine them in all theſe particulars, and ſee whether the Spirit of God be not departed from thee, yea or no?—I now come to the Application hereof.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Conſider, that though the quickenings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may be withdrawn from a godly man, yet the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Spirit can never be withdrawn; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, oh beleever, lie not down in deſpaire, and deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The Spirit to thee is but as the Sun under a cloud, it is in the firmament ſtill: ſo is the Spirit in thy heart,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115133:38"/>and though it be under a cloud as to the influence of it, yet it is conſtantly with thee as to its preſence. A Believer may have the truth and being of grace in him, though not the comfort of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider then, Oh childe of God, who ſayeſt that theſe ſymptoms diſcover the departure of the Spirit from thee. Why, remember that God did never continue the Spirit in its motions and workings alwayes alike in any godly man. It is with thy ſoul in this caſe as with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things: in the water of the ſea there is an Ebbing and Flowing: in the ſeaſons of the year there is the Winter, as well as the Summer; and the Autum, as well as the Spring: as it is thus with the times and ſeaſons in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, ſo alſo is it in Spiritual things; the Spirit of God was never continued to all men alike, but there are Ebbings and Flowings of it. As it is in the Aire, ſo it is in the heart, ſometimes it is clear, and ſometimes clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The Sunne in the firmament, it is alwaies there, yet it doth not always give the ſame warmth and heat and influence upon the earth. What is true of the Sunne in this reſpect, is alſo of the Spirit of God in the hearts of his; it hath not always the ſame influence upon the heart. The time may be that thou mayeſt be in thy winter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thy graces may not have a verdure, and greenneſſe, and yet ſtill the Spirit is in thee, and will in the ſpring-time cauſe thee to flouriſh. The tree may have life in the root, when during the Winter-ſeaſon it may have neither leaves, nor bloſoms, nor fruit. A childe of God may have his life hid in Chriſt, the root of all ſpiritual life, though it may be winter-ſeaſon ſometimes with him both in reſpect of the growth, exerciſe and comfort of grace.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115133:38"/>note which one hath upon <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.6. It is ſaid there, <note place="margin">Cant. 3.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Who is this that cometh out of the wilderneſſe, like pillars of ſmoak, perfumed with myrrhe, and frankincenſe?</hi> By him who came out of the wilderneſſe is not meant Chriſt, but the ſpouſe of Chriſt. Now here obſerve two things, ſhe comes out of the wilderneſſe.—That the Church may be an afflicted Church, though a Religious Church. It alludes to the great trials by which God exerciſed his people with when he led them through the wilderneſſe of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And then ſhe is ſaid to come out of the Wilderneſſe like a Pillar of ſmoak: Now what is meant by that? A Divine gives this ſenſe of it: Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they may have ſmoky duties, blackt with many foul infirmities; they may be Pillars of ſmoak: thy duties may be much ſooted; but now what is thy comfort? though it be ſaid the Spouſe came out like a Pillar of ſmoak, yet ſhe was perfumed with myrrh and frankincenſe; that is, ſhe had the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt to perfume her duties; he perfumes my duties with the myrrh of his own righteouſneſſe. And when the prayers of the Saints which are compared to incenſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.2. are offered by Chriſt, they go up to heaven as a moſt ſweet and acceptable ſacrifice, far more acceptable and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come then the coſtly evaporations of the moſt preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Arabian</hi> gummes. Oh then let this bear up thy heart; thou art black by reaſon of thy infirmities, yet there is a perfume which can ſweeten all thy duties. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>That the Angel came and ſtood at the Altar having a golden cenſer, and there was given unto him much incenſe, that he ſhould offer it with the prayers of all the Saints upon the golden Altar which was before the throne.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 8.3,4.</note> This doth not make for the Popiſh opinion, as if we ſhould uſe the Mediation of Angels; but by the Angel here is not meant a created Angel of the Lord, but the Angel of the Covenant who is the Lord; and what was his office? he had much incenſe, and this much incenſe he offered with the prayers of the 
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115133:39"/>Saints, all the people of God they ſhare in the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, to cover their imperfect duties. And then it is ſaid, that <hi>the ſmoak of the inoenſe which came with the prayers of the Saints, aſcended up before God out of the Angels hand;</hi> that is, the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt is ſented with the prayers of the Saints unto the Lord, whereby they are accepted.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And laſtly, this may be your comfort, though thou canſt not performe duty without infirmity, yet thou doeſt performe duty without known hypocriſie; though thou doeſt offend in the manner of performance, yet thou wouldeſt not be falſe in the end or principle of thy doing: the ſincerity of thy heart herein may be thy comfort, and from ſuch, though the Spirit may withdraw for a while, yet 'twill not be long before it return again; who though to humble thee, he may for a while withdraw in anger, yet he will returne again; <hi>In a little moment have I hid my face and forſaken thee, but I will gather thee with everlaſting mercy.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. If you conſider the weakneſſe and diſability of our natures to holy motions, as well as to holy actions. <note place="margin">Phil. 2.13. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

A Mole can as eaſily move the earth from its centre, or a ſparrow drink up the waters of the Ocean out of their channels, as thou of thy ſelf have any good motion, or ability to act good; all your aſſiſtance comes from the Spirit of God, and therefore ſayes Saint <hi>Paul, If ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the fleſh.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.</note> Thou art weak in thy ſelf, therefore that ſhould make thee ſee thy need of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:115133:40"/>2. Conſider, not only the weakneſſe, but the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe that is in us unto that which is good. And therefore the Scripture mentions not onely a grieving and quenching, but alſo a reſiſting of the Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. And therefore thoſe phraſes of Scripture, <note place="margin">John 6.44.</note> 
                     <hi>Draw me, and I will runne after thee;</hi> And <hi>None can come unto me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Father which hath ſent me, draw him;</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note not only a weakneſſe, but an unwillingneſſe in us to come, and a backwardneſſe alſo in our hearts to yield ſubjection to a law of holineſſe. <note place="margin">Pſal. 110.3.</note> Till God by his Spirit make us a willing people in the day of his power.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Be convinced of the great need you ſtand in of the Spirit, from thoſe ſtrong reſiſtances that are in your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to holy motions. Though grace be of an active nature, yet becauſe there is an indiſpoſition in the ſubject, therefore grace muſt be put on by the Spirit. Fire (you know) it is of an active nature, apt to burne; but let fire be put to green or wet wood, the greeneſſe of the wood reſiſts the prevalency of the flame: thus it is with grace in our natures, it is like fire in green wood, there muſt be much blowing before it will burne; therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle uſes theſe words to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.6.</note> ſayes he, <hi>Stirre up the gift of God, which is in thee,</hi> Blow up the coales. There is much reſiſtance in our hearts againſt the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. You have great need of the Spirits motions, if you conſider the abundance of evil motions which will break in upon thy heart, if the Spirit in its motions be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn What a receptacle for the devil and luſts will thy heart be, if the Spirit abſent himſelf. As ſmoak comes out of a chimney, ſo will corruption come out of thy heart. As ſparks out of a blown fire, ſo will evil moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons come into thy heart when corruption is blown with temptation. Thou art unwilling and backward to good, it muſt be the Spirit wich muſt ſtirre thee up. To this purpoſe you have a paſſage in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, He wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth me morning by morning,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 50.4.</note> ſayes he; thou haſt need to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115133:40"/>be awakened, and excited by the Spirit of God day by day, becauſe of thy daily indiſpoſition. From hence ſee the need thou haſt of the Spirit of God.</p>

                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Poſit. </seg>2</label> It is not enough you be convinced of the need you have of the Spirits motions, but alſo you ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced what a great gulfe of miſery you are plunged into if the Spirits motions be reſtrained; which will appear upon this threefold account.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is recorded in Scripture as a great miſery, if but the common workings and gifts of Gods Spirit be withdrawn; <note place="margin">1 Sam. 28.</note> and therefore you read what a lamentable complaint <hi>Saul</hi> made becauſe the Spirit was departed from him, which was but in its common gifts. And ſo alſo of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> it is ſaid he wiſt not that the Spirit was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him, that is, the Spirit of fortitude; <note place="margin">Judg. 16.20.</note> and is this a lamentation when the Spirit in its common gifts ſhall be withdrawn? and ſhall it not be looked upon as a ſad miſery, when the Spirit in its ſaving, comforting and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying operation ſhall be withheld?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Be convinced hereof, becauſe whileſt the Spirit is withdrawn thou art under a conſtant loſſe.</p>
                  <p>I may exemplifie it by this compariſon: Suppoſe a great Merchant that had a ſhip at ſea, richly laden, and this ſhip ſhould be neer the harbour, but being becalmed or having croſſe windes, it ſhould not be able to come to its haven. Now all the while the ſhip is out, the Merchant is at a daily loſſe. Make it your caſe in a ſpiritual ſenſe, this ſhip is thy ſoul, the lading is grace, and the haven is heaven, the gales of winde, are the motions of the Spirit, croſs gales that ariſe, are temptations; now if the motions of the Spirit help thee not, thou wilt not be able to come to the haven: from hence ſee your miſery without the motions of Gods Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Be convinced of thy miſery, becauſe if good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do not poſſeſſe thy heart, multitudes of evil moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will; if the houſe of thy heart be empty of good motions, the devil will enter by evil motions, and dwell
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115133:41"/>there. <note place="margin">Mat. 12.44,45.</note> Either thy heart is an habitation for the Spirit of God, or elſe it is a receptacle for the evil ſpirit with all its ſinful motions. The ſoul is a reſtleſſe active thing, and when the good Spirit doth not act it, the evil ſpirit will; the devil will ſlippe no oportunity that may advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, he will not let any houſe long ſtand empty.</p>
                  <p n="3">

Our natures are as <hi>gunpowder to fire,</hi> if a ſpark of temptation fall upon us, how ſoon are we all on a fire? but to good motions out hearts are as green <hi>wood to the fire,</hi> what oppoſition is there in us, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe to entertaine them? Evil thoughts in the ſoul are natural, but good thoughts are ſupernatural. Mans heart by, nature is a ſlaughter-houſe to holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; many good motions haſt thou ſtifled and ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in thy heart; but that nature which is a ſlaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe to good motions, it is a ſtore-houſe to wicked motions. <hi>An evil man out of the evil treaſure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is evil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 6 45.</note> (ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) what a natural receptiveneſſe is there in thy heart, for the intertaining of that which is evil?</p>

To grieve the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. is more unkindneſſe then to reſiſt the Spirit; a man is more troubled for the unkindneſſe of a friend, then for all the hatred and oppoſition of his enemy. Surely ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is the matter, haſt thou not kept thy conſcience naſty? it is naſtineſſe in the dove-houſe, that cauſes the dove to leave the houſe. Is there not an indulgence of ſome allowed provoking ſinne that the Spirit of God ſees in thee? haſt thou not quenched the Spirits motions? haſt thou not grieved the Spirit; vexed, reſiſted, or tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115133:41"/>the Spirit. Search out the cauſe, and when thou haſt found it, then bewaile it, and cry, Wo is me! the Spirit would have taken up his reſidence in my heart, and I would not give him entertainment. And ſo whom I have begg'd with teares and enjoyed with comfort, I have loſt through the folly of my ſinful doings. If thou haſt not yet found out the cauſe, I would have thee to conſult with thy own conſcience, which is Gods officer in thee, and it will give thee a true account if thou wilt hearken to it; ask it theſe three queſtion: Have not I fallen from my firſt love as the <hi>Epheſians</hi> did? <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.4,5. Have I not ſtifled checks of conſcience, and the Spirits motions? Have I not proſtituted the Spirits mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſervile and baſe imployments, as <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> for ſecular advantage and worldly intereſt? haſt thou not addicted thy ſelf to contrary motions? haſt thou not been more ready to hearken to the ſolicitations of the evil ſpirit, then to the incitations of the good Spirit? Aske thy conſcience; it may be it will give in this anſwer. Hath not the Spirit departed becauſe of thy pride and idleneſſe and ſelf-conceitedneſſe? by ſuch like propoſals as theſe to conſcience, thou mayeſt come to know the cauſe wherefore the Spirit is withdrawn from thee.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. It is true that God doth uſually withdraw the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Spirit becauſe of ſinne, and therefore ſayes the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Your iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſai. 59.2.</note> and ſo alſo the Prophet <hi>Micah, They ſhall cry unto the Lord, but he will not hear them, he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelve ill in their doings.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Micah 3.4.</note> Uſually ſinne is the cauſe for which the Spirit of God withdraws.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is moſt true, that if there were not ſinne in us, Gods Spirit ſhould never be withdrawn from us; we
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115133:42"/>ſhould be uncapable of deſertion of the Spirit, were it not for ſinne in general; and therefore though ſinne in general be the <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> yet it is not alwayes the cauſe immediate for which the Spirit withdraws.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though there be ſinne in us, as a cauſe to us why Gods Spirit departs, yet God doth not alwayes make ſinne a cauſe to himſelfe, but it is for ſome other higher ends. Divines that handle this ſubject touching the deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoul, and the withdrawings of Gods Spirit, they diſtinguiſh a threefold deſertion, upon a threefold cauſe, and we have touched upon that already.</p>

There may be a deſertion which is cautional, not for ſinne, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.7.</note> but to prevent ſin; And thus it was with <hi>Paul, There was given to him a thorne in the fleſh, a meſſenger of Satan to buffet him, leſt he ſhould be exalted above meaſure.</hi> And ſo <hi>Peter</hi> when he fell in denying Chriſt, his deſertion was cautional, <note place="margin">Matth. 26.70.</note> that he might not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own ſtrength (as he had moſt fooliſhly done) for after-time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There may be a deſertion which is probational, that is, to try ſome grace which God would have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; and thus <hi>Job</hi> he was not afflicted for ſinne, but God did thereby prove him and try him in his faith and patience.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a deſertion which is penal, and that is for ſinne, when God leaves a man to himſelf; and thus it was with the Spouſe, <note place="margin">Cant. 5.3,4,5,6.</note> becauſe ſhe hearkened not, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened not to Chriſt, therefore he withdrew himſelf.—Art thou therefore deſerted by the Spirit of God? why, remember that deſertions are not alwayes penal (though I confeſſe they are moſt often ſo; and it is moſt ſuitable to that humble and penitent frame of heart, that ſhould be in a deſerted ſoul to judge himſelf ſmitten and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God for his ſin:) but ſometimes they are caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and ſometimes probational.</p>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115133:42"/>miſery in the Spirits abſence. It is the fault of many Chriſtians, they reſt contented in fruitleſſe, and dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful complaints of their loſſe, but do not put forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious indeavours to recover what they have loſt. It was not enough for <hi>Joſhua</hi> to lie upon his face at the defeat at <hi>Ai, Joſhua</hi> 7.10.11.—but he muſt ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his feet and finde out the cauſe, and endeavour to make up the breach. There are ſome profeſſors who by whining and complaining think to excuſe their idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſpiritual ſloth.—Thou haſt loſt the Spirit; do not ſo much pore upon thy loſſe, as to think what thou muſt do to recover the Spirit again.—Which that thou mayeſt do, follow theſe directions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Cleanſe thy conſcience from the allowance of any known ſinne, make thy heart clean and ſo fit for Chriſt, and his Spirit will come unto thee; let thy heart be like that roome Chriſt came to eat the Paſſeover in, <note place="margin">Luke 22.12.</note> an upper roome, a furniſhed roome, and a ſwept roome; let thy heart be prepared and ſwept with the beſome of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied grace, from the allowance of ſinne, and this will be a means for thee to recover the Spirit again.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Go unto God by prayer, which is the univerſal remedy for all ſpiritual diſtempers. <hi>Is any among you afflicted, let him pray,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">James 5.13.</note> Let the affliction be what it will, prayer will be a means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee. Prayer is injoyned by God as a means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spirit of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. And it will ſpeed, becauſe it is Gods ordinance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Do not only pray, but bewaile thy condition in prayer; Spread thy complaints before the Lord, and ſay, Lord, how is my heart a cage of uncleane birds? a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle for ſinne, and the devil? This is the beſt that my heart is now fit for. I who once had my graces freſh and flo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115133:43"/>bleſſed, and like unto the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> caſting forth my roots and pleaſant branches: But now I am as a tree of the forreſt which brings forth nothing; I once was as a fruitful vine in the vineyard of Chriſt, but now am like unto the mountains of <hi>Gilboa</hi> upon whom neither the rain nor the dew falls; thus bewaile thy ſelf in the preſence of the Lord, and it may be when he ſees thee with tears in thy eyes, and thy petitions in thy hand, he may returne unto thee. Though he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken thee, yet he will not forget thee; though he hath caſt thee down, yet he will not caſt thee off for ever, <hi>(He will not cast away his people)</hi> if thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakeſt not him; labour therefore by prayers and tears to recover thy fall.</p>

This is a fault among many Chriſtians, eſpecially among thoſe who are troubled in conſcience, all their complaints are for want of aſſurance and comfort, and I do not know whether Chriſt be mine, or no; into this channel all their ſorrow and grief runnes. And therefore it is much to be feared, that rather ſelf-love then love to Chriſt is the ground of many ſuch complaints as many make when they ſay they are deſerted; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is a more ſad judgement, if thou wanteſt the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening and exciting motions of the Spirit, then if thou wanteſt the witneſſe and comforts of the Spirit; it's more ſad to have the Spirits gracious motions with-held, then to have the Spirits comforts withdrawn.</p>

Thus you may be left of the Spirit, and you may not know it; and the reaſon is, partly becauſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partures of the Spirit are gradual; (You cannot diſcerne a mans growth, becauſe he grows by little and little.

                  <p n="1">1. The Spirit when it moves a man to good, it doth not onely excite him to it, but doth alſo aſſiſt him in the doing of it. <note place="margin">Rom. 8.26. 2 Tim. 1.7.</note> Therefore the <hi>Spirit is ſaid to help our infirmities, making interceſſion for us with groans which cannot be uttered.</hi> The Spirit of God it is <hi>a Spirit of power</hi> to enable us in good duties; as it excites, ſo alſo it aſſiſts in what it moves to.—But though natural motions from conſcience may put a man upon the doing of a good thing, <note place="margin">—<hi>Video me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liora probóque, Deteriora ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</hi>
                     </note> yet it cannot give any power for its performance; it leaves thee like <hi>Ovids Medea,</hi> that ſaw good, yet would not do it. Natural motions to the ſoul are as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to the Iſraelites, who moved them to make brick, but gave them no materials. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſcience moves to duty, but conveighs no power to do it withal; therefore you read that the law is weak through the fleſh; <note place="margin">Rom. 8 3.</note> weak as to juſtification thereby, there being no power in man to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil it.</p>

Hence we read that <hi>God hath not given us the Spirit of fear, but of power, of love, and of a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115133:48"/>ſound minde;</hi> we do not do things meerely out of fear of hell, but out of love to God and holineſſe. So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit are the Sonnes of God; for ye have not received the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.14,15 <hi>Ducuur à ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu, non trah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
                     </note> The Spirit of God makes a man do a thing, as a childe, out of love to his father, and not out of fear; this is the effect of the Spirit of God. But now the motions of natural conſcience to good, are not out of any excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency a man ſeeth in the good he doth, but meerly out of feare of puniſhment; he ſeeth damnation if he doth otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Spirit of God moves a man to do good in things not only good for the matter, but to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the end why he doth ſuch a thing, that he be ſound in his aime; and therefore ſayes the Apoſtle, <note place="margin">2 Tim. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>We have received the Spirit of a ſound minde;</hi> that is, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it puts a man not only upon the doing of a good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but makes him have a ſincere end in the doing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: But the natural conſcience it reſts in the duty, in caſe it be done, though done never ſo corruptly. <note place="margin">Prov. 7.14.</note> As the harlot <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, who had ſacrificed and paid her vows, though her end was moſt abominable and baſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſhe might the more uncontrolable play the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot; ſhe firſt playes the hypocrite, and then the harlot.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Spirit of God moving men to do good, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates them in the manner of doing good; the duty it muſt be done with affection, with love, with faith, ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and compoſedneſſe of minde; but natural conſcience moving a man to duty, takes no farther care, ſo it be done, not how it be done; it may move to prayer, and to hearing, but never moves to take heed how theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are done.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Spirit of God moves a man ſo powerfully that it carrieth him to do good notwithſtanding difficulty and danger, and neither ſhall hinder him in its perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115133:49"/>The Spirits motions are like unto new wine in a barrel, that wanting vent is ready to burſt; holy motions will break forth into holy actions. Wicked men are ſick till they act their wickedneſſe, and cannot be ſatisfied till they have done ſinfully: But thoſe who have natural motions to good they go no farther, but reſt in them, and never bring forth good accompliſhments. <hi>Balaam</hi> he had a good motion, <note place="margin">Num. 23.10.</note> oh (ſayes he) that <hi>I might die the death of the righteous, and that my latter end might be like unto his.</hi> What a heavenly ejaculation was here! it was a very good wiſh, but yet it was a lazie one; he wiſht to die the death of the righteous, but yet would not live the life of the righteous; he would not practiſe what he prayed for.

Difficulties do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage natural men from following their good reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with conſtant practice; and the ſluggard will not plow, becauſe of the cold, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.4.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That the motions of Gods Spirit are alwayes agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a written word; the words preſcript and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits motions are correſpondent the one to the other.

                     <note place="margin">Prov. 1.23.</note> So the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of thy mouth, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:115133:49"/>2. The motions of Gods Spirit in men, are not now to foretell future events, but they are holy motions preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to duty: Therefore the Papiſts who boaſt of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Spirit, and of foretelling things to come; and your ſtarre-gazers and ſooth-ſayers, who pretend to tell future contingent events, telling you, this party ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile this moneth, and that party another moneth, theſe are diabolical deluſions, and not from the Spirit of God; who ſince the Canon of the Scripture hath been eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, refers us to the Word as a rule of our obedience.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Spirits motions, where ever they are, they ſtirre up grace and keep under ſinne; they ſtir up grace, and therefore we read of the aſſiſting, exciting and ſupplying work of the Spirit; thoſe motions which ſtirre up ſinne, and cheriſh corruption, are diabolical. <note place="margin">Rom. 8.13</note> Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, If ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die; but if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="1">1. In the meaſure; though a Reprobate partakes of the motions of the Spirit, yet he hath not ſuch a meaſure of the Spirit as a regenerate man hath. <hi>Forbes</hi> in that practical Tract of his concerning this doubt, gives you this exemplification. <note place="margin">Summis tuntam labris pitiſſare.</note> Wicked men (ſayes he) partake of the Spirit, <hi>as Coocks do of the meat;</hi> they dreſſe, they taſte of as much as will reliſh their palates, but do not take ſo much as to make a meal of, which may refreſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſtrengthen it: But the regenerate are as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited gueſts, and they not only taſte the meat prepared, but alſo make a meale thereof. Wicked men they have but a taſte, and therefore ſayes the Apoſtle of them,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115133:50"/>
                     <hi>They have taſted of the heavenly gift.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 6.3.</note> They are juſt like unto men going by an Apothecaries ſhoppe, who may ſmell the ſweet ſents of his pots, but only the ſick pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient gets benefit by his cordials: Thus it is with the wicked, God he may and doth give them taſtes of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but they have not ſo much as will do their ſouls good. It is only the godly who have ſaving participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of grace. As there were many of the Iſraelites who had a taſte of the fruit of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who yet never came to heaven; ſo ſome may taſte of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly gift, who ſhall never come to heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They differ, as in the meaſure of their receiving the Spirit, ſo alſo in the manner.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Motions of the Spirit in the reprobate they are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient, and gliding, not laſting motions; they paſſe like a ſhadow. And therefore ſaith the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Ephraim, Your goodneſſe is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it paſſeth away.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hoſea 6.4.</note> As the riſing Sunne diſſipates the clouds, and dries up the dew; ſo do the motions of the Spirit in Reprobates ſoon vaniſh and paſſe away. But the motions of the Spirit in the godly, they are like an old inhabitant, they dwell with him; and therefore ſaith our Saviour, <hi>If my words abide in you, ye ſhall aske what ye will, and it ſhall be done unto you.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 15.7.</note> The words of Chriſt are tranſient, and as ſojourners in the wicked, but abiding in the godly; they ſtay with a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man all his life-time; he is one that hath alwayes a conſcience void of offence, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16. <hi>My ſoul break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the longing it hath to thy judgements at all times,</hi>

The motions of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the godly, they are not by fits and ſtarts, but they are abiding and laſting motions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are rare and ſeldome, not ordinary and uſual; as they ſtay but a while, ſo they come but ſeldome, now and then upon ſome extraordinary emergencies. It is in this caſe with the Reprobate, in regard of good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115133:51"/>As it is with a man in a lottery, to one prize he may draw a hundred blankes: ſo wicked men they have a hundred Satanical motions to evil, for one motion of Gods Spirit to good, they are as rare and ſeldome, as it is to ſee a Swallow in Winter. While a wicked man is think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil thoughts, he is in his own element, and he as familiarly doth that as breath; but good thoughts are but as ſtrangers in his heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Spirits motions in wicked men, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, not voluntary; they are not in them as water which proceeds from a fountaine, but as water coming from a ſtill, forced by reaſon of the fire underneath it.—The Spirits motions in wicked men they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained upon a double ground.—Firſt, either from natural conſcience, which tells them they muſt not be ſuch devils incarnate, as never have any good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Balaam</hi> he had a deſire to curſe the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, yet natural conſcience prevaiſed with him to the contrary; <note place="margin">Numb. 23.12.</note> and ſayes he, <hi>Muſt I not take heed to ſpeak that which the Lord hath put into my mouth?</hi>—Or ſecondly, this may proceed from the ſenſe of outward judgements, this may occaſion the entertainment of good thoughts. <hi>When their fear cometh as deſolation, and deſtructions as a whirlewinde, then ſhall they call upon me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 1.27.28.</note> It muſt be a whirlewinde of feare which drives them to call upon the name of the Lord, agreeable to that of the Prophet <hi>Hoſea, In their affliction they will ſeek me early.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hoſe 5.15.</note> When the Iſraelites were afraid of the thunder and the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening, <hi>They ſaid unto Moſes, Speak unto us all that the Lord our God ſhall ſpeak unto thee, and we will do it, Deut.</hi> 5.26,27.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Motions of the Spirit in the Reprobate, they are caſual and accidental, not ſtudied, and conſidered; ſuch which fall in by the by without preparation, or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; motions which tumble in they know not how. The wicked man he conſulteth evil thoughts, therefore (ſayes the wiſe man) <hi>He ſhutteth his eyes to deviſe froward 
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115133:51"/>things.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 16.30.</note> Shutting of the eyes it is a poſture which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues intentions of minde; thus wicked men they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive how to bring about a miſchievous device, and are ſtudents in ſinne; and to this purpoſe ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul,</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. Good motions in wicked men they are partial not univerſal, as moving them not to good at all times, ſo neither to all good. They may have motions to move them to the doing of outward good things, ſuch whereby their names may become to be ſpoken of with applauſe, but not to the doing of all good; their motions to good put them not upon the mortifying of ſtrong luſts, and keeping under ſin; whereas the Spirits moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to good in the godly they are univerſal, to one good thing as well as another. <note place="margin">Heb. 13.18.</note>

                     <hi>Herein do I exerciſe my ſelf to have alwayes a good conſcience void of offence, toward God, and toward men.</hi> There is a univerſality in the motions of Gods Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearts of the godly. The whole heart being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto all good, and that alwayes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Motions of the Spirit in the wicked, they are fruitleſſe motions, which have no influence upon their lives. One ſaith, that the heart of a fool is like unto a cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheel, &amp; his thoughts like a roving a xletree, as a cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheel it goes round and round all the day, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.17 Iſa. 51.1. Daniel 1.8</note> yet ſtill abides where it uſed to be: ſo wicked men it may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they have good thoughts, and good motions, but yet theſe have not an influence upon his life, his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to good are fruitleſſe motions. But motions to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115133:52"/>good in the godly are joyned with practice, and holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes joyned with prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.2.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The motions of Gods Spirit in Reprobates, they are for good things done in publick, not in private; thou wilt do good, that thy name may be cryed up. The winde of vaine glory may blow the ſaile of thy heart, and fill it with good motions. <label type="milestone">

It is reported of one that could faſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral dayes in a Monaſtery, but not halfe a day in the Wilderneſſe; and being asked the reaſon, he gave this anſwer. When I faſt in the Monaſtery, I feed upon vain glory and the praiſe of men, but not ſo in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe: It is ſo with formal profeſſors; their motions are ſuch which put them upon outward and viſible good, but never upon inward and ſecret duties to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine their hearts, to watch over them, to keep cloſe communion with God in ſecret; if thou comeſt ſhort of this, thou comeſt ſhort of the effectual and ſaving mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit.</p>

How often do men walk in the ſtreets, and yet obſerve not which way the winde blowes? as it is with the winde, ſo is it with the Spirit, the Spirit comes with many a ſweet gale, and yet we do not obſerve it. That as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid of the Lord,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115133:52"/>
                     <hi>He paſſed by, and he ſaw him not,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job 9.11</note> ſo may we ſay of the Spirit of God, <hi>It was nigh me, and I perceived it not.</hi> Thus our Saviour ſpeaks of the world, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive the Spirit of truth; <hi>Becauſe they neither ſee him, nor know him.</hi> The meaning is not, <note place="margin">John 14.17.</note> as if they could ſee the Spirit with a bodily eye, for the Spirit is not a bodily ſubſtance, but they neither ſee him nor know him, that is, they ſee not his motions, neither have any experimental knowledge of the Spirits workings. Natural men are unacquainted with their own Spirits, and much more with the motions of Gods Spirit. We cannot ſee the Sunne but by its own light, nor obſerve the Spirit without the Spirit. There are many in the world like unto that Ruler of the feaſt, when Chriſt turned the water into wine, <note place="margin">Joh. 2.9.</note> it is ſaid <hi>He knew not whence it was.</hi> I may allude to this Scripture thus; there are many men whoſe water the Spirit would turne unto wine, that is, their corrupt motions into holy and gracious motions, yet they do not know it, neither will they ſee it.</p>

If you are not guilty of inobſervancy of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits motions, yet be humbled for the infirmity of the fleſh, that you cannot alwayes imbrace the Spirits motions when you know them.

                  <p n="3">3. Be humbled, though knowing them, yet becauſe you cannot bring theſe motions into holy practice; there are many men who entertaine the Spirits motions, but alas they act not theſe gracious motions. The Spirit moves to pray better, to heare better, to live more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, and yet ſtill they remain as they were, and though ſometimes they may reſolve to live better, yet how ſoon are theſe reſolutions forgotten; ſuch may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine with <hi>Job</hi> in this caſe, <note place="margin">Job 17.11.</note>

Chriſts nature it was like unto a Cryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſe filled with pure water, the devil ſhook the glaſſe, but it was ſtill clear; but when the devil comes to us he findes us as a puddle of water, and he doth but take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this puddle, and how doth the mudde appear? A dunghill may have herbes and flowers grow upon it, 
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115133:53"/>but if you rake, and digge into it, how quickly will the ſtench thereof take away the ſweetneſſe of the flowers? though our natures ſeem not to be ſo bad as they are, yet if the devil do but rake into them, then will it appear what we are. The heart of man may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a tinder-box, the corruption of nature to the tinder in this box; now let but the devil ſtrike flint and ſteele together, that is, ſuite a temptation to our corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and how ſoone are we ſet on fire? Chriſts nature it was like Iron, it would not take with the ſparks, but the devil he tempts, us and our natures are like tinder to the temptation; What cauſe have we therefore to be humbled and greatly to be abaſed in the rememberance of the receptiveneſſe of our natures to take in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils ſuggeſtions.</p>

It is the fault of many Chriſtians, they let good motions die in their breaſts, and ſo they come to an untimely iſſue. <note place="margin">Daniel 1.8.</note> That of <hi>Daniel</hi> is for our imitation, <hi>He purpoſed in his heart that he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file himſelf with the portion of the Kings meat, nor with the wine which he drank, therefore he requeſted of the Prince of the Eunuchs, that he might not defile himſelf.</hi> He did not reſt in the bare motion, and purpoſe, but he made it his requeſt, he joyned endeavour to his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but as for us, how may we (as I before told you) take up the complaint of <hi>Job, Our purpoſes are broken off, even the thoughts of our hearts:</hi>

There are many in theſe dayes that will take upon them to tell you future contingent events, but this can be nothing elſe but a deluſion of the devil, becauſe the gifts of the Spirit in foretelling future events is now ceaſed, and doth not remaine in the Church. It is true I deny not but that the devil by a ſpecial manifeſtation from God may tell a future event, but I am ſure your Aſtrologers cannot by the help of the ſtarres. Thus the devil appeared to <hi>Saul</hi> in the ſhape of <hi>Samuel,</hi>

Thus the devil in the Delphick oracle told <hi>Alexander,</hi> that both the <hi>Caldean,</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchies ſhould be under his government, the devil told him ſo.

                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:115133:57"/>1. Be much in holy diſcourſe with good company; converſing with thoſe who have the Spirit about ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, is a likely advantage for thee to gain the Spirits motions. What Chriſt did whileſt he was upon earth, that will he yet do by his holy Spirit. You read when the two Diſciples were going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 24.15.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning and reaſoning together, that Jeſus drew neere and went with them; Chriſt will draw neere to thoſe by the motions of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>pirit, who are diſcourſing about holy things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Give due attendance to the ordinances of God; they are that poole which the Angel at certain times will move. It is a Text worthy of obſervation, which you read of in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where the Lord ſayes, <note place="margin">Iſa. 30.20,21</note> 
                     <hi>That thy Teachers ſhall not be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes ſhall ſee thy Teachers, and thine ears ſhall hear a voice behinde thee, ſaying, This is the way, walk ye in it.</hi> Mark the connexion; you ſhall ſee your Teachers, and in ſeeing them ſhall heare a voyce, that is, of the Spirit. The ordinances are they which convey the Spirit in its motions to us: and to this purpoſe I may accomodate that of the Prophet <hi>Zachariah,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Zech. 4.12</note> where it is ſaid, that the two Olive-branches did empty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the golden oile, by the two golden pipes, and ſo it ranne into the Candleſtick. This Candleſtick is the Church, the oile is the motions of Gods Spirit, and theſe motions they runne through ordinances; they are thoſe golden pipes which convey the Spirits motions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your hearts. It is with the motions of the Spirit and holy ordinances, as it is with the blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the veines and Arteries; for as theſe convey the blood and ſpirit to each part: ſo alſo ordinances convey the graces and comforts of the Spirit to each believing member of Chriſt. Waite upon the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, and then waite alſo upon prayer; that will be a means whereby you ſhall obtaine the Spirit. Chriſt he makes this an incouragement to prayer. <note place="margin">Luke 11.13.</note> 
                     <hi>If
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115133:58"/>ye then being evil know how to give good gifts to you children; how much more</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>ſhall your heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father give the holy Spirit to them that aske him?</hi> Go therefore to God in prayer, and that will be a means to bring the Spirit into thy heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Be much alone in holy meditation. Chriſt could tell you that he was alone, and yet (ſayes he) <hi>I am not alone, becauſe the Father is with me;</hi> So you, if you are alone in meditation, yet you will not be alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Spirit will be with you in its holy motions. That as <hi>Iſaac</hi> when he went forth to meditate, <note place="margin">Gen. 24.63,64</note> it is ſaid that then he ſaw <hi>Rebeccah,</hi> that mercy he ſo long pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for: ſo may I ſay to thee, be much in meditation and the Spirit which thou haſt prayed for ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in unto thee. <note place="margin">1 Kings 19.12.</note> As <hi>Eliah</hi> when he was in the mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aine, he perceived that the Lord was in the ſtill voice; ſo will the ſoul at laſt perceive, that though the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is not in the ſtrong winde of boiſterous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, yet he will be in the ſtill voice of holy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</p>

This is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful rule. Men are apt if they have a good motion to intitle it unto the Spirit; whereas there may be a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115133:58"/>thouſand good motions in thy minde, which may meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come from moral perſwaſion. Meere nature may make a Reprobate go farre; how do you read of flaſhes of joy in <hi>Herod?</hi> he heard <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> gladly; of pangs of fear, and horrour in <hi>Felix?</hi> and fits of ſorrow and grief in <hi>Judas?</hi> yet all theſe came from the force of moral perſwaſion, and were not ſaving workings of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>That you may not be miſtaken about moral perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I ſhall give you four differences between it and the Spirits working.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Moral perſwaſion it may move a man to do good, but it never changes the affections. And therefore you read of thoſe, <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.10.</note> 
                     <hi>That did not receive the truth in the love of it.</hi> Which intimates that men may receive the truth in the motion of it, and yet not in the love of it. <note place="margin">Eph. 4.15. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> And hence are thoſe expreſſions <hi>Of ſpeaking the truth in love,</hi> or doing the truth in love; whatſoever you do you muſt do it in love. Now moral perſwaſion may move you to do a good act, but it never draws out your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in love to the things you do.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Moral perſwaſion preſſes men to do good, but it gives them no power to do the thing it perſwades to. Moral perſwaſion may give a man an eye, to ſee what is to be done; but the Spirit it gives not only an eye, <note place="margin">Rom. 3.26.</note> but a hand alſo, and helps us in the doing of that good where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it perſwades.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Moral perſwaſion moves men to do good more out of hope of reward, or fear of puniſhment then of love to grace, or holineſſe; it looks more at what God gives, then what he requires; and hath more reſpect to the reward of grace, then to grace it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Moral perſwaſions they are partial perſwaſions; they move a man to ſome kindes of good, but not to all good; to good that may be eaſily done, but not to diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult duties; to outward, but not to inward good: but the Spirits motions they are univerſal; there is no good 
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115133:59"/>act, but the Spirit it moves a man to.</p>

                     </label> To which I anſwer, 1. Negatively, we muſt not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this, as if ſo be we were not to have any luſts of the fleſh in us. But ſecondly, that if you walk after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits motions, you ſhall not yield to the motions of ſinne, with ſo ſtrong an inclination and bent of the will as wicked and unregenerate men do, ſo you ſhall nor fulfill the luſts of the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Before I come to handle the Doctrine, I ſhall premiſe theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This benefit here annexed may be underſtood, either preceptively, or promiſſively; either as a precept what you ſhould do, or as a promiſe what you ſhall do. And the Tranſlators of the Bible it ſeemes were at a ſtand, how to render theſe words <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Beza</hi> renders them <hi>ne perficite</hi> preceptively, fulfill not; the vulgar; <hi>ne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficietis,</hi> you ſhall not fulfill.—Which our tranſlatours followed, but as you may perceive, put alſo the other rendering and reading in the Margin. But it is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial which way you take it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This promiſe, (for ſo it ſeems to be taken) it is not to be taken abſolutely, but conditionally; my meaning is this, God doth not promiſe this abſolutely, but upon this condition, <hi>If you walk in the Spirit,</hi> on this condition, <hi>you ſhall not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is not ſaid, you ſhall not have the luſts of the fleſh; for what man is there which hath them no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>? but you ſhall not fulfil them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <note place="margin">

                        </gap>
                     </note> We read in our tranſlation the luſts of the fleſh; but it is in the Greek, <hi>The luſt of the fleſh,</hi> in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115133:61"/>—Now what may be the reaſon that though the Word be in the ſingular number, yet it is read in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral? For this reaſon, becauſe the ſinne of nature, though it be but one Maſſe of ſin, yet it hath many ſinsin the womb of it; and there may be this uſe made of the tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That though the ſinne of nature be but one, yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally there are all the ſinnes in the world contained in it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Touching the benefit annexed, there is no cauſe of doubting to be left in your mindes, that this benefit ſhall not be yours, if you perform the condition. Do you walk in the Spirit, and God will keep you that you ſhall not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh; and this I draw from the Apoſtles <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> in theſe words; <hi>This I ſay then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye ſhall not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh. This I ſay,</hi> as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, This is that which I have to ſpeak unto you in the name of the Lord, that if you walk in the Spirit, you ſhall not fulfill, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now having premiſed theſe particulars, the Doctrine is this.—</p>

                     <hi>That Walking after the guidance, or motions of the Spirit,</hi> is an eſpeciall means to keep men that they ſhall not yeeld to the luſts of the fleſh with ſo ſtrong and full a bent of the will, as wicked and ungodly men, when they ſin againſt God.</p>
                  <p>This is a very fruitfull point, the promiſe is not to be taken abſolutely, you ſhall not fulfill them at all; but comparatively, you ſhall not ſin as wicked men do; you may ſin, but you ſhall not regard iniquity in your heart, as the phraſe is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. you ſhall not commit ſin, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  <p>In the handling of this point I ſhall onely diſpatch this one thing, to ſhew you how the wicked do ſin, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the luſts of the fleſh, that all godly men which walk after the guidance of the Spirit, ſhall not ſo ſin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They who walk after the Spirit, they ſhall not ſin 
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115133:62"/>ſo wilfully, <note place="margin">Heb. 10 26.</note> nor ſo voluntarily as wicked men do. <hi>If we ſin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin.</hi> Godly men they do not ſin with ſo ſtrong a bent of will, as wicked men do; ſin they do, and they ſin with their wils too, but there is much reſiſtenice in the will againſt the will; it is not a full conſent of the will, nor a full bent and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the heart: and therefore ſayes the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, The evil that I would not, that I do.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.19.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> he tels you he did evil, but he tels you alſo that he did not will the evil he did. A godly man he ſometimes yeelds to ſin, as to an uſurping Tyrant, but never as to his naturall Lord. Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men they will the evil they do, but godly men will the good they do not.

Ahab,</hi> it is ſaid of him, that he ſold himſelf to work wickedneſſe; but of <hi>Paul</hi> it is ſaid, that he <hi>was ſold under ſin.</hi> They were both ſold, but there is this difference. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab he ſold himſelf;</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> was ſold, he did not ſell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Ahabs</hi> act was a voluntary act, he ſold himſelf; but <hi>Paul</hi> was ſold under ſin, it was not voluntary, but againſt his will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe who walk after the Spirit, they do not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the luſts of the fleſh ſo impudently as wicked men do. Wicked men they commit wickedneſſe before the Sun, and are not aſhamed; therefore ſayes the Lord by his Prophet, <note place="margin">Jer 6.15. Chap. 8.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Were they aſhamed, when they had c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115133:62"/>him, and with an impudent face ſaid unto him, I have peace-offerings with me, this day have I payed my vows.</hi> Thus wicked men they ſin impudently, and are not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med when they have committed abomination; but the godly they do not ſo ſin. <note place="margin">Rom. 6.21.</note> 
                     <hi>What fruit had ye then in thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle.) And <hi>Ezra, Oh God, our iniquities are increaſed, I bluſh and am aſhamed to look up.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezra 9.6.</note> The godly they do not ſin ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently as wicked men do.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Neither ſo boaſtingly as wicked men, ungodly men they boaſt in their ungodly deeds; and therefore ſayes the Pſalmiſt to <hi>Doeg, Why boaſteſt thou thy ſelf in miſchief, oh mighty man?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 52 1.</note> It ſeems <hi>Doeg</hi> did not onely kill thoſe innocent Prieſts, but boaſted of his villany and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Hence it is ſaid, <note place="margin">Phil. 3.18,19.</note> that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul wept over ſome that were enemies to the croſſe of Chriſt, whoſe glory was in their ſhame,</hi> that is, in their ſin. A regenerate man may act ſin, and hide ſin; nay, he may extenuate ſin, he may mince the matter, and put off, and excuſe it all he can; but we never read of a regenerate man which did boaſt in his ſin. A godly man may go neer, <note place="margin">Jer. 11.15.</note> ever to the ſuburbs of hell, by his ſin; but he never glories in ſhame, nor boaſts of his ſin.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Godly men they ſin not ſo rejoycingly as wicked men do. The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> tels you of ſome, <note place="margin">Prov. 10.23.</note> 
                     <hi>that when they did evil, they rejoyced.

                     <hi>but a man of underſtanding hath wiſdom,</hi> that is, he hath more wiſdom then to make a ſport of ſin, he knows that they <hi>ſhall be damned, that have pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe;</hi> and therefore he dares not ſin rejoycingly as other men do; he hath wiſdom rather to mourn for it, as <hi>David, I will declare mine iniquity, I will be ſorry for my ſin.</hi>

                     <hi>He that committeth ſin, is of the Devil.</hi> It is not ſaid, He that ſins, but he that commits ſin, that is, he that <hi>makes ſin.</hi> The word is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from Artificers, that are skilfull and cunning about their work. Godly men are bunglers about ſin, but wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men they do it artificially. Hence it is ſaid, that <hi>they are wiſe to do evil; And skilfull to deſtroy. David</hi> he tells you, <hi>The proud have forged a lie againſt me.</hi> It is bad to tell a lie, but worſe to forge a lie. It is an expreſſion drawn from Smiths, that when they would bring a piece of iron into any curious frame, they bring it to the forge. Wicked men, they are as skilfull in the way of ſin, as if they were bound aprentice to it. Therefore we read of them, that their tongues <hi>are ſaid to frame deceit.</hi> It is ſaid, that Chriſt at laſt day will put away thoſe who are <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of iniquity;</hi> all are actours of iniquity, but all do not work iniquity, that is, they do not make a trade of ſin, neither are cunning in the curſed craft of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Godly men, they ſin not ſo deliberately as wicked men do. A godly man (it is true) may be carried to ſin through the violence of temptation, and through the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſneſſe of his own ſpirit; but he doth not deliberate ſin, pauſe, and conſider with himſelf how he may commit it: <note place="margin">Micah 2.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Wo be to them that deviſe iniquity and work evil upon their beds: and when the morning is light they practiſe it. Wicked men are ſaid to ſhut their eyes to deviſe froward things.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 16.30.</note> Which is a poſture which argues the intentnes of the minde, becauſe by opening of the eyes many objects are adminiſtered, whereby the minde is diſtracted. Thus wicked men, they plot, contrive, and deliberate, how they may commit ſin: wicked men are ſtudents in ſin.

There is difference betwixt the deliberating about the act of ſin, &amp; between a deliberation to find out an occaſion how to commit ſin. A godly man he may be deliberate about the act, he may rowl the Sun in his fancie; but a godly man doth not deliberate how to finde an occaſion whereby he may be wicked. There was a deliberation in <hi>David,</hi> when he committed adultery, but he did not deliberate about the occaſion to finde it out; he did not go to his houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top, thinking with himſelf that there he ſhould ſee a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to luſt after; but when he was there, the Devil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with an occaſion, and when the occaſion was found out, then he did not deliberate how to commit that foul ſin. The like may be ſaid about his deliberation in the death of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> for though he did it deliberately, yet the violence of the temptation that then was upon him, preſſed him thereunto. But now wicked men they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate how they may finde occaſions to ſin, they are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils to themſelves, plotting how they may do miſchief, they tempt the Devils to tempt them.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Godly men, they do not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115133:64"/>ſo eagerly, and intently as wicked men do, who are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly ſet upon their luſts. The adulterous thoughts of the wicked are compared to the neighing of a well-fed horſe, which is a very ſtrong deſire, <note place="margin">Jer. 5.8.</note> and to the fury of a horſe ruſhing into the battel; <note place="margin">Chap. 8.6.</note> wicked men are as eager in the purſuit of their luſts, as ever a horſe was to ruſh into the battel. <note place="margin">Exod. 32.22</note> You read in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. that the people were ſet on miſchief, which intimated their eagerneſſe to do wickedly. How eager was <hi>Amnon</hi> to ſatisfie his luſt? inſomuch that he was ſick: And how ſick was <hi>Ahab</hi> for <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard? they were ſo intently bent upon their luſts. But good men though they ſinne, yet they do not ſinne ſo eagerly, and therefore the Apoſtle he makes this a difference between godly and wicked men, the wicked they commit all iniquity, <note place="margin">Eph. 4.19. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  <p n="8">8. Godly men they do not ſin ſo reſolvedly as wicked men do; wicked men are ſo reſolved upon their luſts that there is no taking of them off. When God bids the people leave their Idolatry, they <hi>ſay, No, we have loved ſtrangers, and after them we will go;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 2.25.</note> as if they ſhould ſay, we have done evil, and we will do evil ſtill; Thus at another time when they had burned incenſe to the Queen of heaven, and the Lord had commanded them to leave their Idolatry, <note place="margin">Jer. 44.16.</note> and threatened to puniſh them, yet ſay they, <hi>As for the word which thou haſt ſpoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee:</hi> They were reſolved to follow their wickedneſſe. A wicked man is ſo ſet upon his ſinne, <note place="margin">Prov. 4.16.</note> that it takes away his ſleep, <hi>He ſleeps not unleſſe he hath done ſome miſchief, and his ſleep is taken away, unleſſe he cauſe ſome to fall;</hi> but godly men they do not ſin ſo reſolvedly. It is true, a godly man may have a purpoſe to act a ſinne, though he may know it to be a ſinne, but a little good counſel will take him off. That of <hi>David</hi> is very remarkable, how reſolved was he to kill <hi>Nabal</hi> and all his family; 
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115133:64"/>and what a bloody reſolution was it? nay he had bound himſelf under an oath, and was going up to execute his bloody reſolution, but at laſt <hi>Abigail</hi> meets him, and by her good counſel how ſoone was he brought off from his reſolution? <hi>And bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.32,33.</note> (ſayes he) <hi>which ſent thee this day to meet me, and bleſſed be thy advice, and bleſſed be thou, which haſt kept me this day from coming to ſhed blood.</hi> Godly men they are not ſo reſolved upon wickedneſſe; a little good advice will bring them off, and they will bleſſe God for ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting counſel, and you for giving it them.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. They do not ſinne ſo contentedly as wicked men. Wicked men they ſinne contentedly becauſe they are in their proper element, when they are ſinning. <note place="margin">Nil gravitat in ſuo centro.</note> Now Philoſophers ſay of the elements; that the earth is not heavy in its proper place. Wicked men they are as ſwine in the myre, it pleaſes them to be there; but for a ſheep to be in the myre, how doth it trouble it? 'tis their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to be in the green Paſtures. Wicked men they not only walk, and ſtand, but ſit down in ſinne, <note place="margin">Pſal. 1.1.</note> which argues their contentedneſſe therein. But it is not ſo with the godly, there is that difference between ſinne in a good man and in a wicked man, as there is between poyſon being in a man and a toade; poyſon in the toade, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents it, becauſe it is natural; but poyſon in a man how doth it offend him? thus it is between ſinne in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and the wicked: Sinne in the wicked it contents him, becauſe it's natural to him; but ſinne in the godly it is like poyſon in a mans body, it tortures, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments him.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. A godly man he doth not ſinne ſo cuſtomarily as wicked men do. A wicked man he makes it his cuſtome to ſinne, it is his way wherein he walks, and therefore ſayes <hi>David, Search me, O God, and know my heart, and my thoughts: And ſee if there be any wicked way in me:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 139.23,24.</note> There may be a work of wickedneſſe in a godly man, but there is not a way of wickedneſſe in him. The
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115133:65"/>wicked are accuſtomed to a way of wickedneſſe, and as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>If the Leopard can cleanſe his ſpots, or the blackmore his skin, then may they alſo who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to do evil.</hi> Sinne in a wicked man it is like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a river, you ſaw it there yeſterday, and you may ſee it to day, alwayes it is there; when they are in a way of ſinne, they are in their proper courſe; but ſinne in a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, it is like the water of a land-flood, you ſee it to day, but to morrow it is gone; ſin it is not a cuſtomary thing to them.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. They who walk after the Spirit, they yield not to ſinne ſo indulgently as wicked men; the Prophet he brands wicked men with this, <note place="margin">Pſal. 58.2.</note> that <hi>in heart they work wickedneſſe,</hi> they ſinne with their hearts; and in another place he ſaith, <note place="margin">Pſal. 5.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Their inward part is very wickedneſſe,</hi> that is, their ſinne it comes from their hearts. Hence alſo they are deſcribed to be ſuch, <note place="margin">Jer. 11.21.</note> 
                     <hi>Whoſe heart walketh after deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things,</hi> they ſinne affectionately; but a good mans heart it is not ſo taken up with ſinne. The wicked are ſaid to hide ſinne under their tongues as a ſweet morſel, but the godly though they may have ſin in their mouths, yet it is there as a bitter morſel, it is unpleaſant to them. A wicked man is as indulgent to his ſinne, though he know it will be his ruine, as <hi>David</hi> was to <hi>Abſolom,</hi> and he deals gently with it; but it's otherwiſe with the godly, for though he be overtaken with a ſinne, yet he takes revenge of it; <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.11. Rom. 7.21,22.</note> and therefore ſayes <hi>Paul, I finde a law that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man.</hi> My in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man is changed, <note place="margin">Verſ. 25.</note> and therefore ſayes be, <hi>With the minde I my ſelf ſerve the law of God, but with the fleſh the law of ſinne:</hi> Godly men they do not delight in a courſe of ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="12">12.

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the ſoul was defiled with corruption imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon its union and conjunction with the body. It is true, there is a conteſt among Divines, when the ſoul comes to be corrupted, ſeeing it is infuſed by creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is therefore pure? But the generality of Authors conclude upon this; that immediately upon the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſoul with the body, the creature is ſaid to have natural corruption; and for this reaſon ſome think that corrupt nature is called fleſh; becauſe man is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally corrupted, aſſoon as ſoule and body joyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

This conflict between the fleſh and the Spirit, it was not found in innocency; then there was an harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the motions of Gods Spirit, and all the powers and faculties both of ſoule and body; <hi>God made man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This conflict, it ſhall not be found in a ſtate of glory; for then thou ſhalt be all Spirit, and no corrupt fleſh; for then the fleſh ſhall be utterly aboliſhed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This oppoſition, it is not found in infancy; it is true, there is a corrupt nature in infants, ſinful motions in children; but there is not that which we call actual oppoſition, becauſe they cannot exerciſe neither grace nor ſin.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:115133:68"/>4. This conflict, it is not found in the ſtate of unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy: while a man is wholly unregenerate, he hath no ſaving motions in him; and there cannot be an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but where there are two contraries.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the time of this life, is the time how long this conflict ſhall laſt; it cannot be ended untill this life be ended; untill thou caſteſt off the body of fleſh, thou ſhalt not be rid of the motions of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That even in the moſt holy that are, there will be this conflict between the <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> and thoſe who have moſt grace, are moſt ſenſible of the conteſt of the <hi>fleſh</hi> againſt the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. That even regenerate men do more often ſide with the motions of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> then cloſe with the motions of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> they are more in ſin, then in obedience; more in imbracing ſinfull motions, then in entertaining divine motions: ſome gather this from the Apoſtles vatiation of ſpeech, when he ſayes. <hi>The works of the fleſh are manifeſt;</hi> but he doth not ſay ſo of the fruits of the Spirit; intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Theſe motions of corrupt nature, they do not only reſide in the inferiour part of man, as the concupiſcible faculty exciting to gluttony and luſts, and iraſcible to envy and wrath; but alſo in the ſuperiour part; (though the Papiſts would make us believe otherwiſe.) The more noble and rational faculties of man are become corrupt, thou art become vain in thy reaſon, and in thy imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; thy underſtanding is tainted, and thy will rebellious; thy affections diſplaced; thy ſuperiour faculties are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.—Now having laid down theſe particulars, I come to raiſe the Doctrine, which is this.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> In particular, there are ſeven wayes by which corrupt nature intices men to ſin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By varniſhing over ſinne with the colour and paint of grace. As a light woman may ſometimes dreſs her ſelf in modeſt attire, that ſo ſhe may not be ſuſpected; ſo thy heart may varniſh over ſinne, that thereby it may the ſooner deceive thee. As it is uſual that the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful face of grace by the corruption of our hearts may 
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115133:69"/>be ſmeared over with deformity; as that tenderneſſe of conſcience may be termed a needleſſe ſcrupuloſity; zeal may be called raſhneſſe, holy walking, needleſſe and preciſe niceneſſe; patience in bearing ſuffering, cowardiſe and lowneſſe of Spirit:—So thy corrupt heart on the contrary may paint over foule ſinnes with the varniſh of grace. So many have painted over the foule ſinne of covetouſneſſe with the vertue of frugality and thrifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, pride called neatneſſe, drunkenneſſe good fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, prodigality may be ſtiled generous magnanimity, and ſuch like varniſh doth the world put upon the deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed face of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>And as for practice, ſo alſo for opinion; how are old Hereſies that may be found in <hi>Euſebius</hi> and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, how are they now termed new lights? how are Satans deluſions termed the Spirits motions? how is looſe walking termed Chriſtian liberty? This varniſhing of ſinne with the paint of ſeeming grace comes from our corrupt natures, and is one way by which the fleſh intices to ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By perſwading thee that there are ſome ſinnes, that there is no fear of thy committing them. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil hath a great advantage over men in this regard. Our own hearts ſometimes tell us that there are ſome ſinnes ſo foule, and ſo contrary to our natural temper, and we think we have ſuch a meaſure of grace, that certainly we ſhall never commit them; thus it was with wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ked <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael;</hi> when the Prophet told him what evil he ſhould do unto Iſrael, that he ſhould <hi>burne their Cities, ſlay their young men, daſh children againſt the ſtones, and rip up women with childe:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Kin. 8.12,13.</note> 
                     <hi>Hazael</hi> could not believe this, but ſayes he, <note place="margin">Mat. 26.35.</note> 
                     <hi>Is thy ſervant a dog that he ſhould do this great thing?</hi> Thus <hi>Peters</hi> heart deceived him; <hi>Though all men forſake thee,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>yet I will not;</hi> but how did his heart deceive him? even a godly man may be thus cheated by his own heart. Men will not believe their hearts to be ſo bad as they are, and when the heart is once brought to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115133:70"/>this to think that there are ſome ſinnes which it ſhall never commit, by that means a man grows ſecure and is thereby the more eaſier drawn unto it. Thus <hi>David,</hi> who made conſcience of leſſer matters, for his conſcience ſmote him for cutting off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment, but he never thought that he ſhould fall into thoſe groſſe and ſcandalous ſinnes of adultery and murder, and ſo his heart grew ſecure and deceived him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The fleſh intices to ſinne, by promiſing to a man pleaſure and delight in the commiſſion of ſinne; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals the hurt and miſchief which comes by it: and how are thouſands deceived hereby? <hi>Every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own luſt and inticed.</hi>

As the devil before <hi>Adam</hi> had a ſinful nature, uſed this engine againſt him: ſo now thy own heart uſes it againſt thy ſelf. <hi>If you will eat,</hi> (ſayes the devil) <hi>you ſhall be as gods knowing good and evil, and your eyes ſhall be opened;</hi> the devil hid the hook, did not ſhew them that they ſhould be driven out of Paradiſe, but hid their danger, and ſo deceived them. Now thy own corrupt heart ſets upon thee in the ſame method. <hi>The way of a wicked man ſeduces him,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 12.26. Prov. 11.18.</note> ſaith <hi>Solomon. The wicked worketh a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful work; but to him that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall be a ſure reward.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pro theſauro carbones.</note> The work of the wicked ſhews him a <hi>ſeeming reward,</hi> but it is only the godly whoſe reward is ſure.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 By perſwading to entertain ſmal and leſſer ſins, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing that if they will but yield to theſe, they ſhall never be troubled to commit greater. This is a great deceit
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115133:70"/>of the heart, wherein thouſands have been taken, whereas ſmall ſinnes they are as an inlet to greater ſins. A little thief put into a houſe, may open the doores for greater, and ſtronger to come in. You know a wedge ſmall and thin in one part, makes way for a greater; little ſinnes they will draw us on to greater. I have read a ſtory of a young man that was tempted by the Devil and his own heart to three ſins; to kill his father, to lie with his mother, and to be drunk: the two former he would not do being abhorrent to nature; but thought he, I will yield to the laſt, becauſe that was the leaſt; which was enough, for being drunk, he did in his drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſſe kill his father, and raviſhed his own mother. Take heed therefore of this deceit of ſin, thy own heart will not prompt thee to all ſin at firſt; but will labour to draw thee on by degrees, from leſſe ſins to greater, untill thou become abominable therein; <hi>Behold,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 3.5.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James, what a great matter a little fire kindleth!</hi> Little ſins yielded to, may be occaſions to bring forth many great ſins; therefore take heed you be not deceived by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt dictates of nature.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>fleſh</hi> will tempt thee to ſinne upon this ground, becauſe it is but a little one; it is but a ſmall ſin, as <hi>Lot</hi> ſaid of <hi>Zoar, Is it not a little one?</hi> but conſider that this is the meere policy of ſin to undo thee; for though there are ſome ſins leſſe then others are in reſpect of the act, yet all are alike in regard of the object; there is no little God to ſin againſt, and therefore there can be no little ſin; ſinne muſt not be meaſured by its act, but by its object. A blow given to an ordinary man, it is accompted as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but a blow given to a great man, how hainous is it? therefore if thy heart ſhall ſay to thee that it is but a little ſin, do thou ſay, The God I ſin againſt is no little God; and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> merit which muſt procure pardon for this ſin, can be no ſmall merit; and the hell prepared for the puniſhment of a little ſin, is no ſmall torment; therefore take heed to thy heart in this regard.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:115133:71"/>6. Thy heart may intice thee to ſin upon pretence of good that may enſue upon thy committing of it; and how many have been intangled in this ſnare? Hereby were <hi>Lots</hi> daughters intangled to lie with their own father, <note place="margin">Gen. 19.32.</note> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this pretence that they might preſerve ſeed of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they ſaw there was no likelihood for a poſterity to come from their father, and ſo thought that the Church of God would ceaſe; here was their end, and therefore for preſerving a ſeed, they would venture to ſin. This is expreſſely againſt the Scripture, which forbids that we ſhould do evil, <note place="margin">Rom. 3.8. Job 13.7.</note> that good may come thereon; <hi>Will ye talk wickedly for God, and deal deceitfully for him?</hi> and if upon pretence of good, we may commit evil; by the ſame rule <hi>Judas</hi> his treaſon may be excuſed, becauſe of the great good coming by Chriſts death. But let me tell you farther, that if you ſin that good may come thereby, it is the way to loſe the good you aime at. It is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able concerning <hi>Saul,</hi> being to purſue the Philiſtines, he gave out a very cruell and harſh command; <note place="margin">1 Sam. 14.24.</note> he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the people, and bound them under an oath that they ſhould not eat a bit of meat untill evening, that he might be avenged of his enemies. <hi>Sauls</hi> pretence was good, but uſing an unlawful means, the people became feeble and faint for food; who otherwiſe might have obtained afar more glorious victory. When men therefore ſhall uſe ſinfull means for the obtaining of good, it is juſt with God to diſappoint them of the good they aime at.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And laſtly, thy corrupt heart will tell thee, though thou may'ſt not boldly act ſin, yet thou may'ſt ſafely ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the occaſion of ſinne, and yet be preſerved. Thus <hi>Peters</hi> heart deceived him; he would go into the high Prieſts Hall, venture upon the occaſion of ſin, thinking that he ſhould not be taken in it. And thus the Iſraelites, they would marry ſtrange wives, and this was an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereby at laſt they fell to worſhip ſtrange gods; keep off therefore from the occaſion of ſin. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath a good ſaying; <hi>Can a man tread upon fire, and not be burned?</hi>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:115133:71"/>his meaning is, that a man cannot keep company with a harlot and be chaſt; running upon the occaſions of ſinne, brings to the acting of ſin: you will not venture upon ice, or ſlippery places, becauſe of the occaſion of falling; and if you deſire to be freed of the one, be not bold to venter upon the other.</p>

Blame not the Devil; it is naturall to men, to take off the blame from their own vicious natures when they fall into ſin, and to lay all upon the Devill; but if you obſerve the Scripture, you ſhall never finde that a godly man did ever lay the blame upon the Devil after he fell into ſin: It is true <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did, but there was ſome reaſon for that, becauſe they had no ſinful nature to 
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115133:72"/>tempt them; but after being fallen, their ſinful nature did tempt them, not the Devil. It is ſaid of <hi>David, that Satan ſtood up and provoked him to number the people;</hi>

David</hi> he charges his own heart, and the reaſon is, becauſe the heart of man hath a greater ſtroak in provoking a man to ſin, then the Devil hath; alas, what could the Devil do, if we had not a ſinful inclination within? The Devil when he came to tempt Chriſt, he found no matter in him to faſten upon him, and therefore he could not prevaile. <hi>The Prince of this world cometh, and findeth nothing in me,</hi> ſaid Chriſt; But 'tis otherwiſe with us, temptations meet with corruptions that do ſuit them. The Devil when he comes to thee, thy heart it is as flax among fire, or as gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder which having a ſpark of fire in it, is ſuddenly blown up; therefore blame not the Devil, but thine own heart; neither the Devil nor the world could hate thee, were it not for thine own heart, which like a falſe Trayter lodgeth within thy breaſt, and betrayes the ſoul to the ſnares and temptations of the Devil.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Come now to give you the properties of this enmity, and of this conflict; and there are nine or ten qualities of this enemy, corrupt nature.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The fleſh it is a potent enemy againſt the Spirit, it is no weak enemy, but it's ſtrong; and therefore ſayes the Apoſtle, <note place="margin">Rom. 6.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Let not ſin reigne in your mortal bodies.</hi> In the unregenerate, the fleſh is as a mighty Monarch, which rules without controule, the fleſh, the power or a Law over them; And in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, ſin is an uſurping tyrant, which gets a great deal of the Beleevers ſoul into his hands: <note place="margin">Rom. 7.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> complaines that he was ſold under ſin; though after his regeneration, he did not ſell himſelf to work wickedneſſe, yet he was taken captive by the fleſh, as by a powerful and prevailing adverſary, and as conquerors ſell their priſoners, ſo was <hi>Paul.</hi>—Divines do uſually compare corrupt nature to great <hi>Goliah,</hi> and grace to little <hi>David; Goliah</hi> had more ſtrength, yet <hi>David</hi> gets the victory; though corruption be potent, yet grace in the end will get the victory.</p>
                  <p>The potency of the fleſh may appear by theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the names which in Scripture are attributed to 
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115133:73"/>corrupt nature, <note place="margin">2 Cor 10.4. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> it is called <hi>a ſtrong hold;</hi> a man may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly win an ordinary dwelling houſe, but it is hard taking a ſtrong hold. <note place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note> It is called a Law, <hi>The Law of ſin;</hi> it hath that power over the ſoul, as the Law hath over the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of a Kingdome; it is ſaid to reigne, having the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that a Prince hath over his people.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It appeares to be potent, by that mighty power which muſt be ſet on work to ſuppreſſe this enemy, no leſſe then the power of an Almighty God, can ſuppreſſe theſe corrupt motions; and therefore ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>The weapons of our warfare, are not carnal; but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.4.</note> It is a weapon edged with the power of a Deity, which muſt pull down theſe ſtrong holds.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Corrupt nature is ſtrong, becauſe it is ſet on by a powerful ſpirit, the Devil; he provokes thee to ſin, and that makes the corruption of thy heart ſo potent. The Sea will move of it ſelf, being a fleeting body; but when a tempeſtuous ſtorme ariſes, then it rages and roares: So is it with thy corrupt nature; if there were no Devil, yet thou wouldſt be a Devil to thy ſelf, and wouldſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin; but when the Devil ſhall ſet on this Sea of thy corrupt nature, then how doth it rage and ſwell? <hi>He is that Prince of the power of the Aire, the ſpirit that now worketh in the children of diſobedience.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It argues the fleſh is potent, becauſe it often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes over the Spirit. The Apoſtle tells you, that not only in wicked men, but even in the regenerate, the fleſh doth many times carry a prevalence over the Spirit; <hi>The Law is ſpiritual,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.14.</note> (ſayes he) <hi>but I am carnal, ſold under ſin.</hi> He ſpeaks of himſelf as a regenerate man; he doth not ſay he ſold himſelf, that was the property of wicked <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab;</hi> but it is meant that corrupt nature did carry him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way captive to ſinne, juſt as a conquerour carries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his priſoner.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fleſh is a potent enemy, becauſe there is a greater meaſure of the fleſh in regenerate men, then there is of 
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115133:73"/>the Spirit; thou haſt more ſin in thee then grace; more of a corrupted nature, then of a renewed nature. In the beſt of Gods children, there is more ignorance then know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; more pride then humility; and generally more ſin then obedience; and this may be hinted from the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue here enumerated of the works of the fleſh, and of the fruits of the Spirit. <note place="margin">Gal. 5.19,20.</note> There are ſeventeen ſins as the fruit of the fleſh, and but ſeven graces as the fruit of the Spirit; to note that there is more of the old nature in thy heart, then of the new; more of the old leaven, then of the new lump; more droſſe, then gold; and this God ſuffers in his children to keep them humble, and in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual dependance upon him; the ſpirits of juſt men are never made perfect till they come to heaven, <note place="margin">Heb. 12.21.</note> and in the mean time it is the admirable power of Chriſt to keep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live a ſparke of grace in the midſt of a ſea of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As the fleſh is a potent enemy, ſo it is a malicious enemy againſt the Spirit; <note place="margin">Rom. 8.7.</note> 
                     <hi>The carnal minde is enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God,</hi> and its maliciouſneſſe againſt the Spirit ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peares two wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It ſuffers no good to be left in it: <hi>I know in me
(that is, in my fleſh) dwells no good thing,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; <note place="margin">Rom. 7.18. <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> though there may be good in the man, yet there is no good in the fleſh, that is, in his ſinful nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is content with nothing, but with the death of the creature in whom it is, and this is a very pernicious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie; it not only kills the Spirits motions, but is mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious againſt the man; <note place="margin">Rom. 7.11. Chap. 8,13.</note> and therefore ſayes the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Sin taking occaſion by the Commandment deceived me, and by it ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o be great indeed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Corrupt nature it is an univerſal enemy againſt the Spirit; and its univerſality appeares in three regards.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The fleſh it is ſeated in the whole man, in all the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115133:74"/>parts of thy body, and in all the powers of thy ſoul. The fleſh is in the ſoul, juſt as the ſoul is in the body; And Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſay, that the ſoul is in the body, the whole ſoul is in the whole body, <note place="margin">Anima eſt tota <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n toto corp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>re &amp; tota in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet parte.</note> and the whole ſoul in every part of the body: juſt ſo is corruption and ſin in thy ſoul, the whole corruption of nature is in the whole ſoul, and in every part of it; in thy body, eyes, eares, hands, in all the parts of it; not only in the concupiſcible and irraſcible part, but alſo in the more noble parts, as in the will, underſtanding, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; it is univerſal in every part of man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It containes in it virtually all ſin. Nothing doth virtually containe all evil, but corrupt nature. As we may ſay of the firſt man, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Primus homo fuit omnis homo.</hi> Rom. 7.8. <hi>Primum pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum fwt omne peccatum.</hi>
                     </note> that he was every man; So we may ſay of ſin, the firſt ſinne had every ſin, that is, every ſin virtually. <hi>Sinne taking occaſion by the Commandment, wrought in me</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>all manner of concupiſcence.</hi> Corrupt nature, it is an inclination to all actual evil in the world: I may illuſtrate this by an egge. An egge hath in it potentially and ſeminally all the parts of the bird, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it wants the warmth of the hen to hatch and produce it: So our corrupt fleſh hath in it all ſin, the ſeed and ſpawne of all ſin, and as the hen produceth the chicken, ſo doth the devil hatch ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It oppoſes all the graces of Gods Spirit; other ſins, take what ſin you will, it oppoſes but the contrary grace; particular ſins do carry but a particular oppoſition; as for inſtance, the ſin of pride, oppoſes humility; luſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth charity; drunkenneſſe, ſobriety; in juſtice oppoſes righteouſneſſe; wrath oppoſes meekneſſe; hatred op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes love; and ſo of all other ſins, they carry but a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar oppoſition to particular graces; but thy fleſh, it carries an univerſal oppoſition to all grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fleſh it is an inſatiable enemy; inſatiable in two regards.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In regard of ſin; becauſe if we yield to the motions of ſinne to day, corrupt nature will not be ſatisfied: if thou yieldeſt to ſin to day, thou muſt to morrow, yea all
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115133:74"/>thy dayes. <note place="margin">Prov. 30.16.</note> Corrupt nature is like thoſe four things which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, which are never ſatisfied; and as he elſewhere ſpeaks, <hi>Hell and deſtruction are never full, ſo the eyes of man are never ſatisfied;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 27.20.</note> that is, corrupt nature in the eye, ſinful concupiſcence in the heart, cauſes an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous eye never to be ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In regard of puniſhment as well as ſin. Suppoſe ſin doth bring diſeaſes upon thy body, or poverty on thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, yet thou wilt not leave it; it aimes at no leſſe then the damnation of thy ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Corrupt nature, it is an indefatigable enemy againſt the Spirit. Suppoſe the fleſh to have all the foregoing properties; yet wanting this, there would be hope that it would be tyred, and wearied out at laſt; but this is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of corruption, it is unweariedly an enemy againſt the Spirit. Things that act naturally, act unweariedly; the fire is never weary of burning, nor the water of ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe it is natural to thoſe creatures; the Sun is never weary of going its courſe, becauſe its motion is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; ſin it is a thing natural to thee, thou waſt borne in in it, and bred up in it, and therefore it acts unweariedly. <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> This war between the fleſh and Spirit, is a truceleſs war.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Corrupt nature it is an inward enemy; it dwells not only with us, but in us; and therefore ſayes <hi>Paul, It is not I, but ſin that dwelleth in me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.20.</note> An enemy without to aſſault a City, cannot do much hurt, if the walls be ſtrong and well mann'd; but if there be traytors within, as well as aſſailants without, it will indanger that City: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thou haſt not only the Devil without, but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature within, a ſin within which ever ſeeks to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray thee. A little thief once gotten in there is more danger of him, then of all the robbers without. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature is this little thief, which alwayes will ſeek to betray thee to the Devil.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This corruption of nature it is a continual enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spirit. There is nothing which acts continually, but corrupt nature; the eye is not alwayes ſeeing; the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115133:75"/>Sea not alwayes flowing; the Sun not alwayes ſhining, but corrupt nature it is alwayes working; the Spirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſend forth a good motion, but the fleſh labours to ſend it back again, and to quen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h it. The Devil is not always tempting, nor the world alwayes vexing, but the fleſh is alwayes reſiſting the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The fleſh it is a politick enemy againſt the Spirit; it works more by flattery, <note place="margin">James 1.14.</note> then by force; <hi>Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and enticed.</hi> It is a Metaphor taken from fiſher-men, which ſhew the baite, but hide the hook; it works ſlyly and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. It is an outragious enemy againſt the Spirit. The Apoſtle exhorting the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to holineſſe, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.5. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1.27.</note> and what is more fierce and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious then fire burning? Corrupt nature, it puts the ſoul on fire; ſo alſo it is compared to a horſe ruſhing into the battell. It is called a drawing of ſin with cart-ropes, to note the eagerneſſe of a ſinner, it is fierce, out ragious and violent.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. It is an equal enemy in all men; it is not in one man more, and in another leſſe; but in all alike, all are equally tainted with it, and there is this reaſon for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all men are equally alike in <hi>Adam,</hi> otherwiſe ſome men ſhould be more in <hi>Adams</hi> ſin then others, which is impoſſible. We are all ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore are all equally polluted; yet this is true, that actuall corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is more drawn out in ſome men then in others; ſome are more profane, ſome more incontinent, ſome more paſſionate then others; becauſe in ſome there are ſtrong natural inclinations, and more prevalent corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions then in others to ſome ſins, yet no man is more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in his nature then another; and therefore thou
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115133:75"/>which art regenerate, thou haſt as much cauſe to bewaile a corrupt and ſinful nature, as any Devil in hell hath. And theſe are the properties of this enemy which wars againſt the ſoul.</p>

In regard of conſtitution the fleſh hath a great advantage; corruption is more ſuitable to thy nature then grace; grace it is above nature, but ſin it is in nature, and with nature; the way of grace is all up the hill, the way to heaven is againſt both wind and tyde; ſo is not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, for that is favoured by both; therefore watch your hearts upon this conſideration.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Proceed now to a fourth Quere, and that is why, or for what reaſon is it that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men God ſhould ſuffer corrupt nature thus to war with the Spirit? Why doth not God deal with us in our regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as he did in creation, make us perfect?</p>
                  <p>This is a queſtion worth diſcuſſing; God loves no ſinne, and yet he ſuffers all the ſinnes that are, and this Maſſe of ſinne, this one ſinne, which vertually is every ſinne. For anſwer hereto I ſhall lay down five Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">Firſt, Corruption of nature is left remaining, even in regenerate men to humble them; even as it was with the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe when they were ſtung with fiery Serpents and Scorpions, <note place="margin">Deut. 8.15,16</note> it was to humble them. So we whil'ſt we are in the wilderneſſe of this world, have a corrupt nature alwayes cleaving to us, wherewith we are ſtung, and this fiery Serpent of ſinne ſhould humble us before the Lord. God hath ſo ordered it in nature, that creatures of the greateſt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115133:78"/>excellency ſhould have ſome manifeſt deformity: if we look either among birds, or beaſts. Among birds, the Peacock a bird of the fineſt feathers, yet it hath the fouleſt ſeet; the Swan a bird of the whiteſt feathers, yet of the blackeſt skin; The Eagle a bird of the quickeſt ſight, and of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt flight, yet the moſt ravenous among birds. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong beaſts, the Lion, the moſt goodlieſt of all beaſts, yet the moſt fierce and cruel: The Fox it is moſt ſubtile, yet is a creature of the fouleſt ſmell: Thus God hath ordained even in nature, and thus it is with his own people in reſpect of grace, though they may have many excellent endowments, and gifts, yet he leaves this corruption in them to humble them. <note place="margin">James 4.8,10.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That of the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> is obſervable, Chap. 4. having ſpoken in the eight Verſe of corrupt nature, in the next Verſe but one, he exhorts men to be humbled; to note that the conſideration of a corrupt heart, ſhould be an incitement to humiliation. It was a ſaying of Maſter <hi>Fax,</hi> that his graces hurt him more then his ſinnes, which riddle he expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus; that many times he was proud of his gifts and graces, but humbled by reaſon of ſinne. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> after he had thoſe extraordinary Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, <hi>There was given him a thorne in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan to buffet him, lest he ſhould be exalted above meaſure.</hi>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115133:78"/>be ſome ſharp temptation and motion to ſin, which did ariſe from the corruption of his nature, and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of luſt. But then it will be objected, how can cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature be called the meſſenger of Satan! To this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines anſwer, that it is called ſo, not as if it were a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the devil; but it is called ſo, becauſe the devil is an inſtrument to ſet on our ſinful nature to ſin; this thorn in the fleſh was left in <hi>Paul</hi> to humble him; and this is the true and proper reaſon why God will not have regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be as perfect as Creation, becauſe he would keep us humble. So it is, that humility the beſt of graces, comes from the worſt root, our ſin; and pride the worſt of ſins, comes from the beſt root, our graces. How wiſe, and how good is God, that by this thorn in the fleſh he doth prick, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by let out the impoſtumation of pride out of our hearts!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To make the regenerate put a difference between earth and heaven, between being in a courſe of pilgrimage, and in their fathers houſe. <note place="margin">Heb. 12.22.</note> In heaven the ſpirits of juſt <hi>men are made perfect,</hi> but they are not ſo on earth, if the ſpirit were made perfect, we ſhould have all ſpirit and no fleſh. In the wilderneſſe there were ſcorpions and fiery ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, but in <hi>Canaan</hi> there were none; this world is a wilderneſſe, and whileſt we live here, the fiery ſerpents of ſin will ſting us, but when we come to heaven we ſhall be above ſin. Corruption now dwells in the ſoul, as the body in a houſe; and ſo long as the ſoul dwells in the body, ſin will dwell there in the ſoul; but when we come to heaven, then corruption ſhall put on incorruption. And we ſhall be freed not onely from the natural corruption of the body, but alſo from the moral corruption of the ſoul by ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Which is the chief reaſon of all; God ſuffers it, that ſo you may the more prize a Mediator; if you had no ſinne you would prize God only as a Creator, and not Chriſt as a Mediator. Sin makes you to prize a Saviour; thus it was with <hi>Paul, O wretched man that I am who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God through Jeſus Christ our Lord;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.24.</note> as if he ſhould ſay, if I had been perfect,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115133:79"/>I ſhould have thanked God as a Creator, as <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe; but now having a ſinful nature, it makes me to prize Chriſt as a Mediator delivering me from ſin. I may exemplify this by an Elephant, which (as ſome ſay) if it once falls to the earth cannot riſe again, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Naturaliſts ſay, that the Elephant doth not lie down to ſleep, but doth ſleep leaning to a tree; now the ſtory is this, An Elephant being fallen to the earth, and a man having helped him to riſe, the Elephant (like <hi>Andronicus</hi> his grateful Lion) followed his Benefactor whereever he went; ſo it is with us, we were fallen, and no help but Chriſts could raiſe us up, how ſhould we then be lift up with humble thankfulneſſe to God, who hath therefore ſuffered us to fall, that we might thereby learn to prize the help we have and hope to have by Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God ſuffers corruption in nature to try his people, which ſide they will take in this conflict; here are two Camps pitcht, army againſt army, and the Lord leaves the fleſh in thee to try which ſide thou wilt take; wilt thou cleave to the ſtrongeſt ſide? wilt thou worſhip the riſing Sun? why, then thou wilt ſide with the fleſh, for many times and for the preſent that conquers; though indeed the final iſſue, and conqueſt will be on the Spirits ſide. Now will you war againſt the fleſh, and ſide with the Spirit in oppoſing the motions of ſin; hereby will the Lord make a trial of you. <note place="margin">Deut. 8.2.</note> The <hi>Canaanites</hi> and <hi>Jebuſites</hi> were left in the land on purpoſe to try whether the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would cleave unto the true worſhip of God: ſo God ſuffers corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bein us, to try the truth of our grace.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Lord ſuffers motions to ſin to be in the hearts of his own people, that ſo he might make uſe of the motions of ſin, to keep men from the acting of ſin, and this is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious conſideration. God ſo diſpoſes of it, that thoſe ſins which we moſt are frequently tempted unto, we ſhall be moſt watchful againſt: A man that is ſuddenly tempted may yield; but a man often haunted with motions to ſin, God in his wiſdome makes uſe of theſe motions to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115133:79"/>prevent the action. Had <hi>David</hi> been often haunted with motions to thoſe great and abominable ſins of adultery and murder, he might happily had time to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelfe, and ſo prevented the acting of them; and the like of <hi>Peters</hi> denial of Chriſt, but both theſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God were ſuddenly ſurprized: And theſe are the reaſons why God leaves regeneration ſo imperfect.</p>
                  <p>The next Quere is, to ſhew what rules you ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that ſo the motions of the fleſh exciting to ſin, may not prevaile againſt the Spirit?</p>
                  <p n="1">1 If you would not have the fleſh in its ſinful motions prevaile over you, then reſiſt them whileſt they are but bare motions, before they break forth into actions; Cruſh the Cockatrice in the egge, tread out ſin which is the fire of Hell while it is in the ſpark, the ſuggeſtion and motion. As we ſay, It is eaſier to keep out an enemy, then to beat him out being once gotten in; ſo it is eaſier to keep out ſin, then to beat out ſin; ſin in the motion it is like an enemy in the ſuburbs, not got into the city; and if thou wouldſt not yeeld to theſe motions, reſiſt them whileſt they are ſo, quench them while they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

Do to thy ſins as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> gave command ſhould be done to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> children; he would not ſtay till the children were grown up to yeares; but commanded the Midwives to kill them aſſoon as they were born; this was a cruel act in him, but thus do thou to thy ſins, and it will be a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful act in thee to thy ſoul, what <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did moſt cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, do thou do prudently againſt thy ſins; kill them when they are in the birth, and there are three cogent reaſons why you ſhould take this courſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe if you reſiſt motions whileſt they are moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you ſhall be ſure not to find the devils ſuggeſtions to joyn againſt you with the fleſhes motions; take but this experiment, if thou haſt a motion in thy nature to ſin, and doeſt act that motion, the devil will then joyn with thy
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115133:80"/>corruption to make thee act that ſin again. The devil he knowes not the motions to ſin that are in thy heart, but as thou acteſt ſuch motions; as ſuppoſe thou art tempted to luſt, and thou yeeldeſt to it, hereby the devil knowes what motion there was in thy heart, and thy love to that ſin, and ſo will be ready to tempt thee to the committing of that ſin again; therefore reſiſt motions while they are ſo, and by this meanes you will hinder the devil, that he ſhall not joyn his ſuggeſtions to the ſinful motions of your own hearts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If you do not reſiſt motions while they are moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there will be a more eager, vehement proneneſſe to ſin in your natures then was before; acting of ſin is not the way to ceaſe and quell a ſinful motion, but to increaſe it; it is as it were a caſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing oile into the fire to make it burn the more: the way therefore to quell ſinful motions, is to withſtand whileſt they are ſo. In Philoſophy we ſay, that acts do ſtrengthen habits; <note place="margin">Habitus acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur actibus, actus confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant habitum.</note> if a man hath a habit of any grace, acting of that grace, makes the habit more ſtrong; thus it is in ſin, acting of ſin begets a greater prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereunto, and therefore it behoves you to keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſins motions, leſt they lead you farther to ſinful acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For ſinful ſuggeſtions when they meet with our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inclinations, the inclination begets conſent; conſent, acting; acting, continuance of act; then delight; then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; and then ſcornful contempt of all reproof, and means of amendment.</p>
                  <p>If you keep not under ſin in its motion, it will be more difficult for thee to ſuppreſſe corruption; if a houſe be on fire, and you can keep the fire within, there is no danger of a great conflagration; but if it break out into the aire, and the winde take hold on it, then it will burn exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: thus it will be with thee in regard of thy ſin, if thou keepeſt it not under in the motion, it will be hard for thee to ſuppreſſe it afterwards. We take phyſick by way of prevention; health of body and ſoul too is more eaſily preſerved then reſtored. A ſore neglected growes
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115133:80"/>a gangrene, one part being infected after another, till there be no ſoundneſſe in the fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Keep off from all external occaſions of that ſin which thou haſt a motion to commit, whatever thy ſin be; ſuppoſe it be pride, wear not that apparel which may miniſter an occaſion of pride; ſuppoſe drunkenneſſe, keep from bad company; if it be uncleanneſſe, <note place="margin">Prov. 5.8.</note> keep off from the dore of the harlot; carefully avoid occaſions of ſin.

And this is the counſel and command of the Lord, Keep thee far from a falſe matter; <note place="margin">Exod. 23.7.</note> the occaſions of ſin are as it were the awakening of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature; what elſe ſhould be the reaſon that a man not thinking of ſin when he hath an occaſion, hath a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to commit it; therefore be not ventrous to run upon occaſions of ſin; and whenſoever thou art moved to any ſin, keep off from the external occaſion thereof. A Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſets out men ventring upon occaſions of ſin to be like thoſe who pray to God they may not be burned, and yet will thruſt their fingers into the fire; thou which prayeſt againſt ſins motions, have a care alſo to keep from ſinnes occaſions. <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 5.27.</note> Gods children are bound to abſtain from all appearance of evil, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.17. and to hate the garment ſpotted with the fleſh, <hi>Jude</hi> 25. <note place="margin">Jude 25.</note> The <hi>Nazarite</hi> was not only to abſtain from wine, but alſo from touching the very husk of the grape, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.3,4. <note place="margin">Numb. 6 3,4.</note>

As the godly have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and the peeces thereof are regiſtred in the 6 Chap. to the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> So the fleſh hath armour to fortify it ſelf; it is armed with power, labour to conquer it; with malice, with an inſatiable deſire of thy ruine, with manifold ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations to ſin. Now labour to diſarm it, of all its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, of all its policies. You muſt do with ſinne in this caſe as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> they fearing that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would wage warre againſt them, uſed this

                  <p n="4">4. Do not ſo much diſpute with evil motions, as reſiſt them. It is the folly of many that they will diſpute with ſins temptations; whereas there is no man that hath ever conſulted with fleſh and blood, but at laſt hath been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by it. Count the fleſh as thy enemy, but never let it be thy Counſellor; the fleſh is a great diſſembler, it hath ſuch ſubtile inſinuations, ſuch ſlie evaſions, that it will cheat a man into ſin, and therefore do not diſpute with it; you will do with diſputing with fleſh, as our firſt parents with the devil, after diſputing they fall to eating; the fleſh will tell thee, this ſin is profitable for thee, and the other ſin is pleaſurable, and ſuitable, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of ſin, and be more in reſiſting, then in diſputing with the fleſh.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Proceed now to the laſt Queſtion, and that is, How you may know when moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſin do ariſe from the fleſh, or when they come meerly from the devil, and ſo are purely diabolical?</p>
                  <p>Before I anſwer the Queſtion I ſhall firſt ſhew of what uſe it is. Secondly, premiſe ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions about it; and then give you the reſolution to this Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is a threefold uſe of this Queſtion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is needful to know it, becauſe unregenerate men when they are tempted to ſin, they lay all the fault upon the devil, and none upon their own hearts. Theſe men when they put all their ſins upon the ſcore of Satan, they do not give the devil his due. Thus <hi>Eve,</hi> ſhe laid all the fault upon the Serpent, <note place="margin">Gen. 3.13.</note> 
                     <hi>The Serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</hi> Though <hi>David</hi> was of another mind; for he when he was tempted and ſtirred up to ſin in his numbering of the people, and that by Satan, yet he doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.17.</note> 
                     <hi>I have ſinned, and I have done wickedly.</hi> It is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to men when they are tempted to ſin, and if they act it,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115133:83"/>to charge the devil with the blame, and therefore it is good for us to know the difference; for we muſt not wrong the devil, but (as they ſay) give the devil his due for ſometimes he is meerly a ſtander by, and hath no hand in our ſinnes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The deciſion of this queſtion will be needful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe regenerate men (eſpecially thoſe troubled in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience) do charge thoſe ſins upon themſelves, which of right ought to be laid upon the devil; as when the devil ſuggeſts thoughts of blaſphemy, which the nature of man riſes againſt, yet will they charge theſe upon themſelves; and therefore as the wicked on the one hand falſely charge the devil, ſo the godly on the other hand untruly charge themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe if motions to ſin be made to ariſe meerly from the devil, then thoſe motions though they are our miſery, yet they are not our ſins if we do not yeeld and conſent to them. The devil layes his baits at our dores, and often as a thief would break into the ſoul, but by faith he is reſiſted, and when once entertained, it's not our ſin. It's to ſin to be tempted, but the ſinne is to yeeld to the temptation. But wicked motions coming from corrupt nature, hough you never conſent unto them; thoſe firſt motions of the minde to ſin, they are materially ſinful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they proced from an evil nature within you; evil mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that do ariſe and ſpring from evil hearts, they are ſuch fruits that do ſpring from an evil root, and therefore we ſhould lament them. For theſe reaſons it is uſeful to anſwer this queſtion; but before I come to that, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber theſe cautions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That whether temptations come from the devil, or from the corrupt nature, yet thou mayeſt be ſure they are both ſinful, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>herefore are both to be rejected.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we are not to be ſo careful to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe motions, as to reſiſt them; for a man to be more curious how to diſtinguiſh, then carefully to reſiſt them, it is but curioſity, not ſincerity.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:115133:84"/>3. There is an apparent difference between motions to ſin which come from the devil, and thoſe which come from corrupt nature, and yet it is hard to ſhew where the indiviſible part of the difference lies, and there is this reaſon which a Modern Divine gives; becauſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture charges thoſe temptations which the Scripture ſayes are from the devil, it layes them upon mens hearts; therefore in the 5. <note place="margin">Acts 5.3,5.</note> Chap. of the <hi>Acts, Ananias</hi> his lie is charged upon the devil, in the third verſe, and upon the man in the fifth verſe.—But to anſwer the queſtion there are theſe characters I ſhall give you to difference thoſe motions to ſin which ariſe from the fleſh, and thoſe which come from the devil.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Motions to ſin from Satan, they are uſually ſuch which are abhorrent to natures light, unnatural ſinnes, at which the very light of nature ſtruggles; and therefore Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines rank temptations to blaſphemy againſt God, and to lay violent hands upon a mans ſelf, to be from Satan, becauſe unnatural; theſe motions do not ariſe primarily from the fleſh, but from the devil; becauſe they are contrary to nature, and therefore not from nature. Temptations unto unnatural evils are from Satan, their horrour ſhews from whom they come, and therefore to think ill of God is purely diabolical, becauſe it is againſt the light of nature to have any low or unfitting thought of God. It is a good note upon that of <hi>Job,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job 1.16.</note> where it is ſaid that the fire of God fell from heaven, and burnt up <hi>Jobs</hi> ſheep. Now why doth not the devil ſtrip him of his ſheep, as he did of the reſt of cattel by the <hi>Caldeans</hi> and <hi>Sabeans,</hi> who did ſteal them away: There is this given as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof: The devil he could not tell how to make <hi>Job</hi> blaſpheme God, and therefore he cauſed a fire from heaven to conſume his ſheep, that ſo he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ight look upon it as that which came from God immediately, and ſo might blaſpheme him; therefore all thoſe temptations which provoke Gods people to blaſphemy, Satan is the chief inſtrument therein; not but that there is in mans
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115133:84"/>nature, as the ſeed of all other ſins, ſo alſo of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; there is a receptiveneſſe in mans nature of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous temptations from the devil: but yet the firſt ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion comes thereof ordinarily and from the devil; <note place="margin">Luke 22.3.</note> and therefore we read that when <hi>Judas</hi> went to betray Chriſt, it is ſaid that Satan entred into him; the motion came from the devil, becauſe it was an unnatural ſinne. For a ſervant to betray a Maſter, and a good Maſter, this is accompted an unnatural ſinne, and therefore it is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon the devil: <note place="margin">Rom. 1.24.</note> Though <hi>Judas</hi> was guilty for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this temptation, yet the Scripture layes it upon the devil, as the firſt motioner of this unnatural ſin: And yet the ſeeds of unnatural ſinnes are in mans nature. And ſo the Apoſtle charges the unnatural ſinnes that he mentions of the Heathens upon the luſts of the heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Motions from the devil they are uſually to groſſe acts of ſinne, which are not ſeated in the inclination and affections. And the reaſon is this; becauſe ſinnes which are groſſe, though there is the ſeed of theſe in the nature, yet men naturally are moſt prone to ſpiritual ſin, and inward ſinne; nature prompts men to inward ſinnes, and the devil to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oſſe and outward ſinnes; and this is the great miſery of man, that thoſe ſinnes the devil tempts not to, thoſe corrupt nature tempts to. <note place="margin">Acts 5.3. Matth. 5.37.</note> 
                     <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> his lie is charged upon the devil; <hi>Why hath Satan filled thy heart.</hi> And ſo is ſinful ſwearing charged upon the devil, it being a ſin of a groſſer nature; it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils work to put men upon groſſe outward acts of evil: But corrupt nature it is ſtill inticing thee to thoſe ſinnes which are moſt ſuitable to thy corrupt inclination, as ſelf-love, vain-glory, popular applauſe, ſpiritual pride, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal confidence, ſiniſter aimes, vain thoughts, and ſuch like; theſe are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>armes of inward luſts, which are bred in thy corrupt nature, and to theſe thy nature inclines thee.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Temptations from Satan are uſually accompanied with much horrour and fear, when they are firſt ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted. 
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115133:85"/>When a temptation is ſo ſtrongly ſuggeſted, that it makes a man quake, and horrour comes upon it; this is an argument it comes from the devil; and the reaſon is this: Becauſe nature provokes to thoſe ſinnes which are moſt pleaſing unto nature; nature doth not raiſea com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion in the minde.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Satans temptations are uſually ſuggeſted, when a fit object and occaſion to act a ſin is preſented, As when a man troubled in minde ſhall ſee water, the devil tempts him to drown himſelfe; or when he ſhall ſee a knife, to cut his throat; or when a man ſees an object of beauty before him, then to be tempted to incontinency; ſuch temptations as theſe uſually come from the devil; it is true, the devil can diſturb the fancy, when there is no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but that is not ſo uſual. But we read of examples in Scripture of thoſe, that when occaſions to ſin have been preſent, then they have been tempted thereunto. Thus <hi>Eve</hi> when ſhe ſaw that the tree was good for food, <note place="margin">Gen. 3.6.</note> and pleaſant to the eyes, there was the object, and then the devils temptation, ſhe took and did eat. And thus it was with <hi>David</hi> when he fell into that ſinne of uncleanneſſe, when he went to the top of his houſe, he had no thought then of being unclean; but being on the top of his houſe, &amp; ſeeing <hi>Bathſheba</hi> naked, the devil tempted him the reto, and then his nature cloſed with the temptation, when the occaſion was offered; motions which come from corrupt nature are uſually, when there is no occaſion offered; and therefore when a man upon his bed ſhal have worldly and covetous thoughts, when there is no occaſion given, this comes from the corruption of his heart; and thus all thoſe ſpeculations and contemplations of the minde about evil, they come meerly from thy own heart; and I muſt tell you, in occaſions and temptations to ſin, though the devil may be firſt therein, yet if after you yield to the occaſion or temptation, you are to blame your own heart more then the devil.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Motions to ſin that come from Satan, they uſually 
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115133:85"/>ſeize ſuddenly upon a man; before that inſtant of time that ſuch motions were ſuggeſted, they were never thought of, ſuch motions as theſe come from the devil; (as <hi>Perkins</hi> ſayes) they flaſh like lightning into a houſe ſuddenly. Thus you read in <hi>Luke</hi> 22.37. concerning <hi>Peter, Simon, Simon,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>Satan hath deſired to winnow thee;</hi> now what is meant hereby? why, it was that temptation, wherein the devil did tempt <hi>Peter to</hi> deny his Lord and Maſter; now it is true that <hi>Peters</hi> heart was to be blamed, for he had the ſeed of that ſinne within him, but yet the Scripture layes it upon the devil, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt in the temptation; becauſe that before that inſtant <hi>Peter</hi> had no forethought of ſuch a thing; but when he came to warm himſelf in the High-Prieſts Hall, then did the devil tempt him thereunto, and then was <hi>Peter</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken therein; ſo that thoſe temptations; which come into a mans minde, which he never thought of before, they come originally from the devil; but motions to ſinne which come from corrupt nature, they are more delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and more laſting, and come not with that violence, and in ſuch a hurry as temptations from the devill come; and the reaſon is, becauſe they are more ſuitable to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo cauſe leſſe violence in the mindes of men.</p>

                     <note place="margin">1 Chron. 21.1.</note> it is ſaid that the devil tempted him to number the people, yet when <hi>David</hi> comes to call to minde that fact, he mentions not one word of the devil, but ſayes he, <hi>I have ſinned, I have done wickedly, and very fooliſhly.</hi> And ſo alſo <hi>Peter,</hi> he denies Chriſt; and the Scripture tells you that the firſt motion to that denial, came from the devil, <note place="margin">Luke 22.31.</note> 
                     <hi>Satan hath deſired to winnow thee,</hi> ſayes Chriſt: Now <hi>Feter</hi> might have ſaid, 'Tis true, I have denied my Maſter, but Satan is in the fault; but we finde not one word of <hi>Peters</hi> againſt the devil, but out he goes, and weeps bitterly; ſo that hereby it appears, though moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſinne ariſe primarily from the devil, yet if thou yieldeſt unto thoſe motions, thou art to blame thy ſelfe, and not the devil.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>2</label> Of reproof. If it be ſo that the fleſh carries an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt the Spirit, then this reproves that Popiſh opinion which holds concupiſcence to be no ſinne. The Papiſts they deny that an inclination or natural tendency in a man to ſin is any evil; or if it be, they ſay it is done away in Baptiſme. And thus the Phariſees they were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that the motions of the fleſh to ſin were evil, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115133:86"/>it was a tenent among them that the law of God did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reach to outward acts, and that the inward motions of the minde were not any way ſinful. But Chriſt when he opened the nature of the Commandments, he taught another doctrine; and therefore ſayes he, <note place="margin">Mat. 5.27,28.</note> 
                     <hi>Ye have heard that it was ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery; But I ſay unto you, that whoſoever looketh on a woman to luſt after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</hi> here Chriſt ſhewes, that not only outward acts, but inward motions to ſin were forbidden by the law of God. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> while he continued a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee, he judged his life by the outward letter of the Law, and ſo thought himſelfe as to the Law blameleſſe: <hi>Paul</hi> never knew the Law was ſpiritual, until he was converted; <note place="margin">Rom. 7.7.</note> and therefore ſayes he, <hi>I had not known luſt to be ſin, if the Law had not ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet;</hi> take heed then not only to the outward actions of your life, but to the inward motions and luſtings of your hearts, for the Law reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to theſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It reproves thoſe who when they have yielded to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motions, are apt to lay the blame any where rather then upon their own hearts; we are apt to transfer the guilt of ſinne any where rather then charge it upon our ſelves. There are three things which men uſually lay the blame upon.</p>
                  <p>Either upon God, the devil, or elſe upon other men.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Upon God, and ſo did <hi>Adam. The woman whom thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me of the tree, and I did eat;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3.12.</note> thus he layes the blame of his fall upon God himſelfe: if thou hadſt not given me this woman, ſhe had not tempted me, and I had not eaten.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others ſay the blame upon the devil, and yet if there were no devil to tempt us, weſhould tempt ourown ſelves; and indeed neither the one nor the other is to be blamed; God is never to be blamed, though the devil be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be blamed; the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> tells you that <hi>God tempts no man.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">James 1.13.</note> And the devil ſometimes is not to be
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115133:87"/>blamed, <note place="margin">James 1.14.</note> becauſe thy own nature is a tempter to thee: ſo the ſame Apoſtle declares that <hi>every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſt and entiſed.</hi> Luſt conceives ſin; the devill may be the Father to beget ſin, but the fleſh is the mother which conceives, nouriſheth and bringeth forth ſin; and the reaſon is this, becauſe the devils ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons could do no harm, were it not for our vicious inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; The devill came to Chriſt, but he found nothing in him; the devil ſhak't the bottle, but it was a Cryſtal glaſſe of pure water, there was no mud in it; but thou, though thou haſt a fair appearance, yet if the devil do but rake into thy heart, the mud of thy corruption doth quickly appear.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Again ſome there are who will lay the blame of their ſinne upon men, and thus did <hi>Aaron,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> chode him for his Idolatry; <note place="margin">Exod. 32.22.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou knowest the people,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that they are ſet on miſchief;</hi> he would fain ſhift off, and excuſe his own wickedneſſe by laying it upon the people, yet this would not ſerve his turn, for God charges the ſin upon him. Nothing is more natural, then to excuſe and hide our ſin, <note place="margin">Job 31.33.</note> and therefore it is ſaid that men cover their tranſgreſſion, as <hi>Adam;</hi> if thy heart were not in the fault, examples of ſin would rather provoke to deteſtation, then imitation. Others there are who will lay the blame upon the badneſſe of the times; whereas if thou hadſt not a bad heart, thou wouldeſt be good in bad times; if thou hadſt a good heart, the worſe the times were, the better thou wouldeſt be; and therefore lay the blame of thy ſin where it ought to be, upon the naughtineſſe of thy evill heart.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Now proceed to the ſecond part of the conflict, the Spirits luſting againſt the fleſh: the fleſh began the onſet firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was fleſh in us before the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but the Spirit doth undertake the war; and as the fleſh luſts againſt the Spirit, ſo the Spirit againſt the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Before I draw out the point, I ſhall clear one Scripture which ſeems to contradict this which is in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. where it is ſaid, that <hi>we wrastle not with fleſh and blood, but againſt Principalities and Powers, againſt the Rulers of the darknes of this world, againſt ſpiritual wickednes in high places.</hi>—This place may be renonciled with the Text two wayes: Firſt, when the Apoſtle ſayes we wraſtle not with fleſh and blood, but againſt Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; the words may be underſtood, not ſimply or abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but comparatively; and if you take fleſh and blood there for corrupt nature, then the meaning is this, that we do not <hi>only</hi> wraſtle with fleſh and blood, corrupt nature within, but we have alſo the devil without, againſt whom we are to ſtirre.</p>

                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:115133:88"/>But the more likely reconciliation of this place is this, it is ſaid in the Text that we do warre with the fleſh, and in the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that we do not warre with the fleſh; now though the ſame word be uſed in both places, yet it is uſed in a different ſenſe, and that you may know how it is uſed in both places, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. Fleſh and blood is ſometimes taken for corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo is that ſaying of Chriſt to be underſtood, <note place="margin">Matth. 16.17.</note>

                     </label> Negatively, There are four ſorts of conflicts againſt
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115133:89"/>ſinne, which come ſhort of the Spirits conflict.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There may be a conflict againſt ſin, by ſin; one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption may conflict with another, and a leſſer ſin may oftentimes be overcome by a greater, and this oftentimes is found in natural men; as pride and covetouſneſſe: a man that is proud, he muſt have ſomething to feed his pride, and becauſe he is proud, therefore he will be in high company, and in brave and rich apparel; now covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe being a contrary vice, may give a check to pride;—So a man that is prodigal, that ſpends his dayes in revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and roaring, inordinate love of the world will tell him that he ſpends too much in money; thus one corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may conteſt with another, and yet may come ſhort of the Spirits conflict againſt ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There may be a conflict againſt ſin in the natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, wherein nature ſeeks to preſerve it ſelfe; As it is with brute creatures, fear many times keeps them from that which their natural appetite would carry them unto; the wolfe would fain worry the ſheep, but his fear of the ſhepherd reſtraines him; ſo between anger and fear: a man that is angry, his anger puts him upon it, that he would fain be revenged on the man whom he is angry with: but another paſſion (fear) tells him if thou killeſt the man thou art angry with, the Law will take hold on thee, this ariſes not at all from the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a conflict which ariſes from a mans natural diſpoſition; ſome men have ſuch heroick and generous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, that they naturally conflict with many vices; as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid of himſelfe, that he was never tempted to the ſin of covetouſneſſe, he was of ſuch a generous and free ſpirit. It was a ſaying of <hi>Plutarch,</hi>—I had rather (ſaid he) that men ſhould ſay there was never any ſuch perſon in the world as <hi>Plutarch,</hi> rather then ſay <hi>Plutarch</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful or unconſtant; of ſuch a noble diſpoſition was this Heathen to ſcorn all baſeneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is a conflict which ariſes from the light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon helped by a natural conſcience, which checks and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trols 
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:115133:89"/>a man for ſin. The Heathens could by the light of natural conſcience ſee and deteſt ſinne, they counted it a baſe thing to proſtitute themſelves to baſe and beaſtly luſts. Conſcience, it is Gods ſpy, and mans overſeer, <note place="margin">Major ſum, &amp; ad majora na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus quam ut corporis mei ſim mancipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note> it is Gods officer in man to warne him againſt ſin; now this is found in unregenerate men, and falls ſhort of the Spirits conflict againſt the fleſh, as ſhall be ſhewed afterwards.</p>
                  <p>But to ſhew you poſitively, what this conflict is: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that the conflict of the Spirit againſt the fleſh, it is a mighty and irreconcileable oppoſition ſtirred up by the motions of Gods Spirit in regenerate ſoules, againſt all the motions of ſin proceeding from corrupt nature; this is a plain and full deſcription of this conflict.</p>

                  <p>In reference to ſin, the Spirit doth theſe five things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It enlightens a man and diſcovers ſin to a man which he never ſaw before; <hi>Thus ſaith</hi> Paul, <note place="margin">Rom. 7.7. John 16.8.</note> 
                     <hi>I had not known luſt to be ſin, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet;</hi> The Spirit of God by the Law diſcovered ſin to <hi>Paul,</hi> and the diſcovery of an enemy, is a degree of oppoſition.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Spirit doth not reſt only in diſcovering ſin, but reſiſts the motions of ſin which proceed from corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the Spirit it luſts againſt the fleſh, that is, it oppoſes the workings of corrupt nature; this is in the Text.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Spirit puts conſcience on work to check and rebuke a man for entertaining evil motions, for making his heart a lodging for ſin; <hi>It convinces the world of ſin.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">John 16.8.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Spirit it ſanctifies the nature of a man, and waſhes him from the filth of ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. and therefore the Spirit of Chriſt is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:115133:90"/>5. The Spirit of God it ſuppreſſeth the motions of ſin' it not only reſiſts, but helps a man to mortify the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſin. <note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.</note> 
                     <hi>If ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; and you have a promiſe for this in the verſe before my Text, <note place="margin">Gal. 5.16.</note> 
                     <hi>That if ye walk in the Spirit, ye ſhall not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh;</hi> he doth not ſay, you ſhall not act, but you ſhall not <hi>fulfill them;</hi> it ſhall not have ſo much power and prevalency over you, as over wicked men; thus as to ſin, you ſee how the Spirit conflicts with the fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reference to the doing of good, the Spirit oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the fleſh ſeveral wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By enlightening and diſcovering to a man what is good; <note place="margin">Iſay 30.21.</note> thus the Lord promiſeth by the Prophet, <hi>Thou ſhalt hear a voice behinde thee ſaying, This is the way, walk ye in it;</hi> the Spirit diſcovers to a man his way, his work, and his duty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not only ſo, but the Spirit ſtirres up holy motions, and holy reſolutions in thee to do that duty; it not only ſhewes thee the way, but preſſes thee to walk therein.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Spirit aſſiſts a man in the doing of good, when the fleſh hinders; <note place="margin">Rom. 8.26. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>We know not what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us, and helps our infirmities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It more and more communicates grace to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whereby they may be inabled to do that which is good; it gives continual ſupplies of help, and therefore you read <hi>of the ſupplies of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 1.19.</note> Thus you ſee wherein the conflict of the fleſh againſt the Spirit conſiſts, both in reference to ſinne, and in reference to good.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>3</label> Seeing there may be a conflict in wicked men againſt ſin, (as I have ſhewed you) ariſing from natural conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; wherein then appeares the difference between that conflict which ariſes from natural conſcience, and that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition againſt ſin which comes from the Spirit of God?</p>
                  <p>This Queſtion is handled by many late Authours. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:115133:90"/>in his Treatiſe concerning the fleſh and the Spirit, and ſo <hi>Downam</hi> and many others; <note place="margin">Vide <hi>Ameſium</hi> de conſcientiâ lib. 2. cap. 11.</note> therefore I would refer you to read them; but yet I would not leave the point wholly: and that you may know the difference, I ſhall lay it down in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>There is a difference, 1. In the manner of this conflict. 2. In the extent of it. 3. In regard of the principles from whence this conflict ariſes. 4. In the time of duration. And 5. In regard of the iſſue and end of this conflict.</p>
                  <p n="1">Firſt, in regard of the manner of this conflict; there is a threefold difference about the manner.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That oppoſition which is in the unregenerate, it is an involuntary oppoſition; if conſcience did not trouble him, he would never trouble ſin, he comes to this battel not as a voluntier, but rather as one impreſt to this ſervice by the impreſſions of a natural conſcience; he comes not to the field like a ſtout Champion, but is dragged thither; Conſcience is Gods ſpie, and mans overſeer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whether a man will or no, it will fly in his face, ſo that the oppoſition from natural conſcience, it is an involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary oppoſition; the commiſſion of ſin is voluntary, but the oppoſition is involuntary. Conſcience in a wicked man is like the light of a candle to a thief, it is ſtill ſhining in his face, whileſt he is in the act of ſtealing: But in the godly it is quite contrary; the commiſſion of ſin is unvoluntary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.19. the oppoſition in them it is a voluntary oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, they rejoyce when the Spirit does its office, when grace in the renewed part doth ſuppreſſe the corruption of their hearts. Wicked men are ſaid to be willingly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, <note place="margin">Heb. 13.18.</note> but the Apoſtle tells you that the godly are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in all things to live honeſtly. Indeed a wicked man is loath to conflict with corruption, his heart would alwayes be in the houſe of mirth, as the wiſe man tells you; <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.4.</note> he is loath that his conſcience ſhould trouble him, he would fain ſtrangle conſcience, he is unwilling to conflict with the fleſh: but a godly man is moſt willing; therefore you read that they groan to be unburthened; (for ſin is the 
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115133:91"/>greateſt burthen) they lie under ſin as a burthen, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.4.</note> and would fain caſt it off.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The conflict which is in the wicked, it is but a jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conflict; it is like childrens playing together, who will wraſtle and ſtrive, but it is only for ſport, not to hurt one another, or as Fencers who will make many flouriſhes, and give one another ſome ſlight hurts, but intend not to kill; it is not like that of the warriour, who comes into the field with an intent to kill his enemy; but thus it is with the regenerate; in their conflict with ſin, they indeavor in good earneſt to kill it, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes. <hi>So fight I</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>not as one that beateth the aire, but I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjection.</hi>

They which are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh (ſaith the ſame Apoſtle,) unto which alſo we have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>That if we through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, we ſhall live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The conflict proceeding from natural conſcience, it is a diſorderly oppoſition, juſt like men fighting in a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult; but the regenerate fight againſt ſin as men in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. <note place="margin">Video meliora probóque dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riora ſequor. Sen. Med.</note> The diſorderlineſſe of the unregenerates conflict ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this, becauſe it is found in different faculties, a wicked man hath a will and deſire to commit ſuch or ſuch a ſin; now there is no regenerate part in their will; there is nothing in the will againſt the will, but there may be ſomething in the underſtanding, and oftentimes there is; and therefore wicked men, though they deſire to do ſuch, or ſuch an act of wickedneſſe, yet their underſtandings tell them, that ſin will not only diſgrace them here, but will damne them hereafter. Thus the conflict in the wicked is in ſeveral faculties, and ſo is diſorderly; but in the regene rate, the combate it is an orderly combate, in the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115133:91"/>ſame faculty, not the will againſt the underſtanding, and the underſtanding againſt the will; but the will againſt the will, and the underſtanding againſt the underſtanding, and the affections againſt the affections; the renewed part of theſe do warre againſt the unrenewed part. So the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, as farre as it is converted, it labours to retain ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truths, and to juſtle out the retention of evill; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate part oppoſes the unregenerate; in the affections, the warre is in the ſame faculty; the love that we bear to God and heavenly things, warres againſt ſelfe-love, the love of the world, and love to ſin. Theſe are the differences between that conflict found in the regenerate &amp; unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate againſt ſin, in reference to this manner of the combat.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In regard of the extent of this conflict, the difference appears in theſe three particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The conflict of a natural conſcience againſt ſin reaches onely to the oppoſing of ſins of life, to outward ſins, but extends not to the ſin of nature, inward ſins; and the reaſon is this, becauſe natural conſcience doth not know natural corruption to be a ſin, and if nature wants an eye to diſcover ſin, <note place="margin">Rom. 7.12.</note> it will alſo want a hand to oppoſe it. <hi>Paul</hi> while he was unregenerate, <hi>knew not that luſt was a ſin,</hi> therefore original ſin falls not under the cognizance of a natural conſcience. We read of wicked men, that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſcience hath gone ſo far as to check them for ſins of life, as <hi>Cain</hi> for his murder, <hi>Ahab</hi> for his idolatry, <hi>Saul</hi> for his cruelty, and <hi>Judas</hi> for his treachery, but nature cannot oppoſe nature, it may oppoſe the branch, but not the root; but it is otherwiſe with a conſcience enlightened by the Spirit of God, it warres with the inward motions and workings of ſin; <hi>Paul</hi> after he was converted, complains of a law of ſin which was in his members, and of a body of death, and therefore you have him crying out, <note place="margin">Rom. 7.24.</note> 
                     <hi>O wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man that I am, who ſhall deliver me therefrom!</hi> natural conſcience may check a man for ſin of life, but onely a renewed conſcience will rebuke a man for ſin of nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Natural conſcience as it doth not reach to ſin of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115133:92"/>ſo neither to the nature of ſin. My meaning is this, natural conſcience it never conflicts againſt the nature of ſin, but only againſt the puniſhment of ſin; it rebukes not a man for ſin under this conſideration, that it is againſt a holy God, and contrary to a holy and pure Law; it is the puniſhment of ſin, and not the nature of ſin, which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſcience relucts at; not becauſe ſin defiles the ſoul, but becauſe ſin deſtroyes the ſoul; not becauſe ſin blots out the image of God, but becauſe ſin keeps men that they ſhall not ſee the face of God; not becauſe God hates ſin, but becauſe God puniſheth ſin. But the regenerate, they do not only through the Spirit conflict with the <hi>ſin of their nature,</hi> but with the <hi>nature of their ſin;</hi> with their ſin, not as deſtroying their ſoules, but as defiling their ſoules; not as tormenting the conſcience, but as polluting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; not as damning the ſoul, but polluting the heart. A natural man may be afraid of ſin, as a childe is afraid of a fire-ſtick, not that it feares to handle it, becauſe it will col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his hands, but becauſe it will ſcorch his fingers. It is a main difference, for a childe of God would abſtain from ſin becauſe of God, not only becauſe of hell. The godly would not offend againſt the purity, holineſſe, authority, and goodneſſe of God, and therefore abſtaines from ſin. The natural man as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>metuit ardere, non me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit peccare;</hi> is afraid to burn in hell, but is not afraid to ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Natural conſcience may conflict with ſinne, yet it comes farre ſhort of the Spirits conflict, becauſe it reaches only to open and groſſe ſins, not to ſecret and ſmall evils. Curſing, it is ſo execrable an evill that a mans own heart wil tel him of it, <note place="margin">Eccleſ 7.22.</note> as the wiſe man ſayes: <hi>Oftentimes thine own heart knoweth that thou thy ſelfe haſt curſed others;</hi> natural conſcience will not ſo often check thee for ſecret and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome-ſins, as ſpiritual pride, wandring thoughts in holy duties, and emptineſſe of minde; but a renewed conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when the Spirit of God comes by it to convince of ſin, it reaches to ſecret ſins, it reaches to the very motions, is well as to actions; and thus it was with the Apoſtle
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115133:92"/>
                     <hi>Paul;</hi> ſayes he, <hi>Sin taking occaſion by the Commandment, Wrought in me all manner of concupiſcence;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.8.</note> whileſt original ſin did work but in its motions, before they were acted, the Apoſtle was ſenſible of them. And ſo <hi>Hezekiah</hi> a good man, it is ſaid that he humbled himſelf for <hi>the pride of his heart,</hi> for the lifting up of his heart, as in that no man could accuſe him of. Theſe are the differences between the conflict which natural conſcience hath againſt ſin, and that conflict which the Spirit hath againſt corruption.</p>

Then—firſt, ſee the reaſon why regenerate men do not live ſo ſinfully as the wicked do. It is not as if good men had better natures then bad men, for the beſt man on earth, yea the moſt glorious Saint in heaven, had as bad a nature as the worſt man on earth. The true reaſon is this, becauſe a godly man hath the Spirit to warre againſt the fleſh, he hath the Spirit to conflict with corruption, <note place="margin">Gal 5.16.</note> and therefore he acts not ſin as wicked men do, <hi>If ye walk in the Spirit, ye ſhall not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 John 3.9.</note> and according to this is that of the Apoſtle <hi>John, Whoſoever is born of God doth not commit ſinne, for his ſeed remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him, and he cannot ſinne, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> He cannot ſin, it is not to be taken abſolutely, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, he ſhall not ſin after that manner, and in that meaſure, &amp; with thoſe circumſtances, as the wicked do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are born of God, &amp; have a ſeed of grace remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them; this is the reaſon why godly men live not as the wicked do. The godly have another kinde of ſpirit in them then the meer natural man hath; he hath the Spirit of Chriſt, whereas the other hath only the ſpirit of the world.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The conflict between natural conſcience and ſinne, may begin aſſoon as ever a man hath light of nature, whilſt a man is in an unregenerate eſtate. <note place="margin">Rom. 2.14.</note> The Apoſtle tells you that <hi>the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law;</hi> that is, natural conſcience it carries the force of a Law with it, and hath power over them, ſo that they ſhall not break out into many evils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to natures light; ſo that the time when a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may conflict againſt ſin, may be whileſt a man is in the gall of bitterneſſe, and in the bond of iniquity: But the time when the Spirits conflict begins, is not till God brings you into the ſtate of grace.</p>

                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:115133:94"/>2. Touching the time of duration, how long this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict continues; it laſts but a while, it is but a tranſient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke given in by conſcience, like unto a flaſh of lightning in a mans face, it comes ſuddenly, and is ſuddenly gone; juſt ſo is that oppoſition which is in a mans natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, either jovial meetings, or ſenſual delights will quickly deface, obliterate and extinguiſh the impreſſions of natural conſcience: But on the contrary, the conflict of the Spirit it is an abiding conflict, untill the regenerate part in ſome meaſure hath got the victory over that luſt which it doth oppoſe; it ſtayes with a man all his life-time, from the firſt day of his converſion, to the laſt day of his diſſolution.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The conflict of a natural conſcience, it comes but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it checks a man but now and then, by fits and ſtarts; as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the Gentiles ſhewes, <note place="margin">Rom. 2.15. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> that their conſciences <hi>between whiles</hi> accuſed them, for ſo the words are to be read; the oppoſition in the unregenerate, it is not a conſtant oppoſition: but the conflict of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it is an abiding conflict in the godly; and as it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues long, ſo it comes often; hardly can a godly man be tempted to a groſſe ſin, but the Spirit will caſt in a croſſe ſuggeſtion to that ſin; this is the third difference, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the conſlict of the Spirit may be known from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict of a natural conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It differs in regard of the principle, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>A fourth diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the conflict, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the fleſh and Spirit, and that conflict which is only between a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſcience and ſin.</hi> Gen. 4.13.</note> or moving cauſe, from whence this conflict ariſes, as:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The oppoſition that is in a natural conſcience, it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from a principle of ſlaviſh fear: but the oppoſition that is in the godly from the Spirit, it comes from a principle of love to God, and hatred to ſin; it appears thus: <hi>Cain</hi> he cries out, <hi>Oh</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>my puniſhment is greater then I am able to bear.</hi> He complaines, not that his ſin was greater then he was able to bear, but of his puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>A wicked man that oppoſeth ſinne from a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, may be compared to a thief that refuſeth and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaineth from ſtealing, not out of any hatred of theft, or
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115133:94"/>out of any love to juſtice, but only becauſe he is afraid of being hanged for his theft; even ſo it is with wicked men, they abſtain from ſin and acting of ſin, meerly out of ſlaviſh fear of hell and condemnation, not out of love to God. I may further exempliſie it thus: you know there is this difference between a Collier and a cleanly man; a Collier will not touch charcole if they be burning coles, but he will touch them, though they be black coles; but a cleanly man will not touch them, neither as they are burning, nor black coles. Wicked men will forbear ſinne, becauſe it is a cole of fire; but the godly will reluct at ſin, becauſe it is a black cole; they love God, and they hate ſin, and therefore ſayes the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, What I would that I do not, but what I hate that do I.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.15.</note> He doth not ſay, the evil I would not do, and the evil I would fain forbear; but the evil I hate, that I do.</p>
                  <p>Divines gather thence, that a godly man conflicts with corruption out of a hatred to corruption; not becauſe he feares the puniſhment, but hates the ſin; wicked men reluct at ſin, but it is not becauſe they hate the evil of ſin, but becauſe they fear the puniſhment thereof; as <hi>Balaam,</hi> he would not curſe the people, yet it is ſaid of him, that <hi>he loved the wages of unrighteouſneſſe;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.15.</note> though he feared the puniſhment, yet he did not hate the ſin. Godly men reluct at ſin, from a principle of hatred thereof; and there are four ſpiritual principles from whence the conflict of a godly man ariſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe that ſin it is againſt a holy God; and this was <hi>Joſephs</hi> principle, <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſſe, and ſin againſt God?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 39 9.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is the breach of a holy Law; thus <hi>Paul,</hi> What <hi>I hate,</hi> (ſayes he) that <hi>I do;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.16.</note> if then I do that which I would not, I conſent unto the Law that it is good; as if he ſhould ſay, I oppoſe ſin out of the conſent that is in my conſcience unto ths Law, that it is good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another principle upon which the godly oppoſe ſin, is a hatred to the very nature of ſin it ſelf; and thus <hi>David</hi> 
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:115133:95"/>profeſſes of himſelfe, that through the precepts of God he got underſtanding, <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.104.</note> and therefore hated every falſe way.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He oppoſeth ſin out of love to Jeſus Chriſt; ſeeing that Chriſt died for ſin, they will labour to die to ſin, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.14,15</note> 
                     <hi>The love of Christ conſtraineth us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead, and that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them, and roſe again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth difference is this; the conflict between the fleſh and Spirit, and the conflict between natural conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſin, differ in regard of the event and iſſue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and there is a fourfold different event and iſſue:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The iſſue of the conflict of a natural conſcience and ſin is this, that it leaves a man unquiet, and the ſin unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; <note place="margin">Matth. 27.5.</note> and this was the very caſe of <hi>Judas,</hi> his conſcience told him that he had ſinned in betraying his Maſter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was ſo troubled, that he went and hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, yet notwithſtanding his ſinne remained unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; but it is contrary with the Spirits conflict, that not only quiets the minde, but mortifies the ſin, and therefore you finde the Apoſtle after he had been ſpeaking of the Spirits conflict with the fleſh, <note place="margin">Gal. 5.22.</note> telling you, <hi>That the fruit of the Spirit is joy and peace;</hi> this was the iſſue of the conflict of the Spirit, it will not only quiet the minde, but kill the ſinne; <note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.</note> 
                     <hi>If ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another event of the conflict of natural conſcience is, that the unruly affections of a man, they are too hard for a natural conſcience to oppoſe and ſubdue. Wicked men will many times contend with ſin; but mark the iſſue, and you ſhall finde, that the ſtrong inclinations of their hearts to ſin, do overcome them. I ſhall give you three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances hereof, in <hi>Saul, Pilate</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>—As for <hi>Saul,</hi> his conſcience told him that he did ill in purſuing <hi>David,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 24 17.</note> and his conſcience conſtrained him to confeſſe that <hi>David</hi>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:115133:95"/>was more righteous then he, and that he had done wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in purſuing his life; and yet notwithſtanding all this, <hi>Sauls</hi> unruly affections did overmaſter <hi>Sauls</hi> unquiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; his ambition of the kingdom cauſed him yet to go on further in the purſuit of <hi>David.</hi>—So <hi>Pilate</hi> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience told him, that Jeſus Chriſt whom he was to judge was an innocent perſon, and therefore he waſhed his hands, and told the people that he found no cauſe of death in him; this was his conſcience, but his ambitious affections did overpower it, fearing leſt he ſhould hereby loſe <hi>Ceſars</hi> favour; <note place="margin">Luke 19.12.</note> 
                     <hi>If thou let this man go</hi> (ſay the people) <hi>thou art not</hi> Ceſars <hi>friend;</hi> he feared this ſaying of the people, and therefore went againſt his conſcience.—And ſo alſo <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> his conſcience told him that he did wickedly in diſobeying Gods command, for letting the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> go, and he confeſſeth that he had ſinned and done wickedly in the Lords ſight, and begged <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray for him: but obſerve, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ambitious affections did over-maſter his conſcience, and therefore when the plage was over, he would continue in ſinne ſtill.—But when the Spirit of God comes to conflict with the luſts of the fleſh, though the affections be unbridled and unruly, yet in time the Spirit of God will check and curb them, and overcome; though the Spirit cannot throw them out, yet it will throw them down, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.27.</note> A godly man thus deals with ſinne, though he cannot give it an utter extirpation, yet he will indeavour to bring it into ſubjection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Natural conſcience in oppoſing ſin, it reſts content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a bare reſtraint of the Act, though there be no mortification of the vicious inclination. As it was with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when the plagues were upon him, then conſcience wrought, but yet his ſin was not at all ſubdued, but onely reſtrained; and therefore ſayes the Text, <note place="margin">Exod. 8.15.</note> 
                     <hi>When</hi> Pharaoh <hi>ſaw that there was reſpite, he hardened his heart, and hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not unto them, as the Lord had ſaid;</hi> And ſo <hi>Haman,</hi> when 
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115133:96"/>he ſaw that <hi>Mordecai</hi> his mortal enemy was preferred by the King; when he ſaw that he was taken into royal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, it is ſaid that he refrained himſelfe, that is, he would not now attempt to deſtroy him; <note place="margin">Eſth. 5.10.</note> and though he refrained himſelf, yet his revengefull diſpoſition remained ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified. Thus a drunkard may be outwardly reſtrained, and yet his drunken inclination remain. But the Spirit of God in its conflict, it doth not only reſtrain the act, but alſo weakens, <note place="margin">Rom. 8.12,13.</note> and ſuppreſſes the inclination; <hi>If ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the fleſh, ye ſhall live;</hi> there is the mortifying of the act of ſin; and thus alſo we are commanded to <hi>mortify our members which are upon the earth, as fornication, uncleanneſſe, inordinate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, evill concupiſcence, and covetouſneſſe;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 3.5.</note> and again, to <hi>crucify the affections and luſts;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5.24.</note> that is, not onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the act of ſinne, but to kill and mortify the ſinful inclination.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And laſtly, natural conſcience conflicting with ſin, it works not more watchfulneſs in a man againſt the aſſaults of ſin for the time to come, but the Spirit of God when that conflicts with a ſin this day, it makes him watchful againſt all ſinne the next day, and all his dayes; and thus you have the third Quere diſpatched, touching the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that is between the conflict of the fleſh and the Spirit, and that combate which is onely between the naturall conſcience of an unregenerate man, and his luſts.</p>

                     </label> This is a practicall, and an uſefull queſtion; and for anſwer thereto, I ſhall give you five directions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Liſten to what conſcience ſhall ſay to you, when you are tempted to any ſin; conſcience, it is Gods ſpie, mans overſeer, and the Spirits officer: and in hearkening to its checks you take a ready way to imbrace the Spirits motions, and deaf your ear to the motions of ſin; it is the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115133:96"/>Spirits office not only to witneſſe with our Spirits, but alſo to check and rebuke us for ſin with our ſpirits; therefore hearken to what your own conſcience ſhall ſpeak, whether it will ſolicite thee after this manner, ſaying, Why wilt thou diſhonour ſo good a God, hazzard thy precious ſoul, and break a good Law? As ſin gives a wound to conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: ſo conſcience awakened, enlightened, and ſanctified gives a great check to ſinne, that it ſhall not reign in a cihlde of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If you would have the Spirit prevail over the fleſh, then be ſure you miniſter no occaſion of ſin unto the fleſh, leſt from vicious motions there come ſinful actions. This rule the Apoſtle gives to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5.13.</note> exhorting them not to <hi>uſe their liberty for an occaſion to the fleſh;</hi> that is, do nothing which may adminiſter an occaſion to the fleſh, to take hold on you. It is true, the fleſh can ſinne without an occaſion, and a man may be an adulterer though he never ſaw a woman, and a man may be a thief though he never ſtole, and a murtherer though he never ſpilt blood; but occaſions to ſin they do the more ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then corrupt nature, as the Philoſophers tells us that acts do ſtrengthen habits: ſo the more thou acts ſin, the more ſtrength it gathers; and hence it was, <note place="margin">Numb. 6.9.</note> that the <hi>Nazarites</hi> who were forbidden to drink wine, were alſo forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to eat any thing that came of the Vine-tree; they were not to eat the raiſin nor the husk of the grape, that an occaſion of ſinne might not be admitted to them. And the wiſe man ſhewing the miſchief of whoredome, <note place="margin">Prov. 5.8.</note> exhorts not to come near the dore of her houſe; it is no ſinne in it ſelfe to come nigh any ones dore; but becauſe being nigh the dore of an harlot, may occaſion and ſtirre up unclean thoughts and luſtful deſires, therefore we are commanded not to come near her dore. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that God would not be called <hi>Baali,</hi> but <hi>Iſhi:</hi> there was no harm in the word <hi>Baali,</hi> for it ſignified in the common uſe of the word <hi>my Husband,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Deut. 25.13.</note> 25.13. where it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a ſmall;</hi> the having of theſe weights in the bag, you would think to be no ſinne; you will ſay, though I have them in my houſe, yet I never buy nor ſell by them, you may ſay they are only in my bag, not in my ſcale; but ſayes God, Thou ſhalt not have them in thy <hi>bag,</hi> leſt it be a temptation to thee to bring them from thy bag into thy ſcale.</p>
                  <p>So the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were commanded not to eat ſwines fleſh, <note place="margin">Levit. 11.7,8.</note> 
                     <hi>Levit.</hi> 11.7,8. Now you ſhall read in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 65.4. how the Lord blames the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for two things, <hi>They eat ſwines fleſh,</hi>
(ſayes he) <hi>and the broth of abominable things are in their veſſels;</hi> God did onely forbid the eating of ſwines fleſh, and yet here he condemns the broth alſo. And why? but becauſe the eating of the broth, might be a temptation to them to eat the fleſh alſo; therefore take heed that you miniſter no occaſion to the fleſh, leſt you be intangled thereby.—</p>
                  <p>An example you have of this related by <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of one <hi>Allipius,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Aug. Confeſ. l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. If you would not have the fleſh prevaile againſt the Spirit, roll not ſinne in your thoughts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations; rolling of ſinne in the fancie and ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115133:97"/>is that which weakens the Spirits motions and workings, and doth ſtrengthen the motions of ſinne in thy heart. <note place="margin">Ezek. 23.19.</note>—This the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks of in Chap. 23. and verſe 19. <hi>She multiplied her whoredomes in calling to remembrance the dayes of her youth;</hi> bodily uncleanneſſe is cauſed by contemplating the ſinne in ones minde, and is the way to fence thy heart againſt the Spirits motions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Proceed now to the cauſe of this conflict, whence it is that the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh; and the Apoſtle aſſignes the reſon, theſe being contrary the one to the other. The words need not much explaining, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſaying of the Apoſtle, when he tells you that the fleſh and the Spirit are in the ſame man, and that theſe are contrary the one to the other; Touching which I ſhall lay down this concluſion, That contraries may be found in the ſame ſubject. It is true that contraries cannot be in the ſame ſubject, in an intenſe and higheſt degree, but they may be in a leſſer and lower degree; and thus it is here. The Apoſtle tells you of the fleſh and the Spirit in the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man, <note place="margin">Contraria non poſſunt eſſe in eodem ſubjecto in gradu in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſo.</note> and of theſe being contrary the one to the other, that is, not in the higheſt, but in a more remiſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; In the higheſt degree they cannot be found, becauſe in heaven there is perfect grace without ſin, and in hell there is all ſin and no grace; but on earth, we are partly ſinful, ann partly gracious, and therefore theſe two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties being in a regenerate man in a more remiſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, 
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115133:99"/>they may be very fairly conſiſtent. Theſe two are contrary the one to the other; it is impoſſible to conceive a more bitter oppoſition and direct contrariety between any thing in the world, then between the fleſh and the Spirit; there is not more contrariety between light and darkneſſe, between heaven and hell, fire and water, then between the fleſh and the Spirit. Contrariety, it is more then enmity; enemies may be reconciled, but contraries never; indeed one contrary may expell ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but one contrary cannot be reconciled to another; water may quench fire, but it cannot be reconciled to fire; and light may expell darkneſſe, but they are not to be reconciled. The contrariety of the fleſh againſt the Spirit conſiſts in this, that whatſoever good the Spirit wills, the fleſh wills; and what good the Spirit excites to, the Spirit diſſwades from; this is the contrariety, and this is the cauſe of the conflict in regenerate men.</p>

                     </label> The Doctrine is this: That there is a mutual and irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable contrariety between the fleſh and the Spirit, between nature and grace, in the hearts of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men.</p>
                  <p>I call it a mutual contrariety, becauſe it is not a ſingle oppoſition, the fleſh is againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh; and then I call it an irreconcileable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety, becauſe though enemies may be reconciled, yet contraries never.</p>
                  <p>In the handling of which point, I ſhall onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the truth of it, and then conclude with a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical application.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Demonſt. </seg>1</label> And firſt, this contrariety appears by the contrary names given both to the fleſh and Spirit in Scripture, as here in the Text corruption it is called fleſh, and grace is called the Spirit; corruption is called darkneſſe, but grace is called light. <note place="margin">Rom. 13.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13 12.

Corruption is called filthineſſe of the fleſh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. but grace is called purity of ſpirit. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115133:99"/>So that by the theſe contrary names given both to the fleſh and the Spirit, the contrariety of both is ſet out.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are both contrary principled and origined; for, Firſt, corruption it is called the work of the devill; and, <hi>For this purpoſe was the Son of God manifeſted, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the works of the devil, John</hi> 3.8.<note place="margin">1 John 3.8.</note> but grace is called the work of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6.<note place="margin">Phil. 1.6.</note> Again, corruption it is called the luſt of the devil, <hi>John</hi> 8.44.<note place="margin">John 8.44.</note> but grace is called the fruit of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.22.</note> ſo that theſe proceed from a contrary original. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 3.6.</note>
                  </p>

They have contrary acts and contrary uſes; the fleſh is ſaid to luſt againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh, they are contrary in their works; and hence in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, ſin it is called a work contrary to God; <note place="margin">Levit. 26.</note> ſin makes a man walk contrary to God, but the Spirit drawes a man to walk in the wayes of God; ſinne is the <hi>Dalilah</hi> that will never let a man alone, but preſſe him with importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to yield to the temptations thereof.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Learn to admire the free grace and mercy of God, that notwithſtanding this contrariety of the fleſh againſt 
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115133:100"/>the Spirit in thee, yet that this ſhould not ſtirre up anger and fury in God, but rather pity and mercy; herein is Gods great love ſhewed to his people. God doth to us as we would do to a man that hath taken poyſon, we pity ſuch a man; but poiſon in a tode that we hate: when God ſees ſinne in his people, tormenting them as poiſon in the body, though they have ſuch ſinful natures, and ſo contrary to grace; yet this ſtirres not up fury, but favour, and pity in God. It is a note worth your obſervation, by comparing two Scriptures together, <note place="margin">Gen. 6.5,6. <hi>Compared with</hi> Gen. 8.21.</note> 
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5,6. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21. In the ſixth of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> it is ſaid there that the Lord ſaw that the imaginations of mans heart were evill, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evill, and that continually; and therefore ſaith God, I will deſtroy man from the earth; there their corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the iſſues and acts of it provoked God to fury; but compare that place with Chapt. 8.21. and there you read that God will not any more curſe the ground for mans ſake, becauſe the imagination of his heart is evill from his youth; this is a ſtrange reaſon, one would think it ſhould be on the contrary, but God doth not bring a curſe, but annexeth a promiſe, as if he ſhould ſay, though I might deſtroy man as I did in the flood, yet I will not do it, though the imagination of his heart be evill, and that continually; no, though his heart be ſo bad: this ſhould teach us to admire the grace of God, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contrariety of our natures unto holineſſe, yet that this ſhould not ſtirre up fury, but rather pity and mercy in God to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Learn to admire the grace and mercy of God, that notwithſtanding the contrariety that is in our natures againſt the Spirit, that yet there is an irreſiſtibleneſſe in the Spirits working converting grace, that the Spirit ſhould conquer a man, and break down the ſtrong holds of nature, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.4.</note> that the Spirit of God ſhould out of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries bring other contraries; for ſo the Lord doth, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding light to ſhine out of darkneſſe.</hi> Oh admire the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency of Gods grace, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6.</note> that notwithſtanding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="1">1. Conſider that the fleſh, and thereby this contrariety againſt grace, it was more ancient in thee then grace was in thee; it was in thee before the Spirit of grace was. Divines make the ſtrugling of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the womb of <hi>Rebeccah,</hi> an embleme of corruption and grace in a regenerate man; they ſtrugled in the womb; and it is obſerved that <hi>Eſau</hi> the bad ſonne was born firſt, and <hi>Jacob</hi> the good ſon born laſt; it is a fit reſemblance of nature and grace which ſtrive in the heart of a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115133:101"/>man, but remember this, that ſin is the elder of the twaine; before thou hadſt the Spirit thou hadſt the fleſh: nature is the elder brother, nay aſſoon as ever there was an union between the ſoul and body, ſin was in the ſoule; nay not only before thou couldſt act grace thou hadſt ſin, but before thou couldſt act reaſon. I remember <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath a relation in his Confeſſions concerning a little childe, <note place="margin">Vidi infantu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Zelantem, &amp;c.</note> which ſaw another childe ſuck his mothers breſt, and ſayes he, before the childe ſpake, I ſaw an envious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in it, the child grew pale to ſee the other ſuck his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers breſt, &amp; this, ſayes he, made me call to mind my origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin; and truly this is a great advantage to the fleſh, that the fleſh is firſt in a man; as if two Armies come to fight a pitcht battel, that Army which firſt comes to the field, hath much advantage againſt the other that come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the field; the fleſh hath gotten the ſunne and winde againſt us, it hath many advantages upon this conſideration that it was firſt in thee, and therefore be humbled.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Be humbled on this conſideration, that the fleſh and this contrariety of the fleſh againſt grace in thy nature, 'tis more abundant in thee then grace is; 'tis not onely more timely, but alſo more abundant; though a Chriſtian hath the Spirit, yet every regenerate man hath more of the fleſh; you have now received but the firſt fruits of the Spirit, but you have the whole crop of ſin, the whole har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of original corruption; in a regenerate man there are more ſwarms of luſts and unholy thoughts, then there are gracious thoughts; as in every hedge there are more bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars and thornes then fruitful trees, ſo in every mans heart, more briars and thornes of corruption, then of the fruitful trees of grace. And as in every field there are more thiſtles and weeds; then lilies and roſes, ſo in every heart there is more of corrupt nature then of true grace. Sin growes naturally, but grace only by divine culture. Corruption is natural, but grace is ſupernatural. That of the Apoſtle is obſervable to this purpoſe, <note place="margin">Rom 6.19.</note> where
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115133:101"/>he exhorts us, <hi>As we have yielded our members to unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to iniquity unto iniquity: ſo now to yield cur mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſervants to righteouſneſſe unto holineſſe.</hi> Divines ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hence, that the Apoſtle ſpeaking of ſin, maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of three <hi>To's,</hi> there is to uncleanneſſe, to iniquity, and unto iniquity; but when he ſpeaks of grace and holineſſe, he mentions but two <hi>To's;</hi> to note that there is more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſin in thee then grace.—Ranſack a believer in every faculty, and in every faculty you ſhall finde more ſin then grace.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, look into the underſtanding, <note place="margin">Hoc tantum ſcio me nihil ſcire. <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nym.</hi>
                     </note> and there you ſhall finde more ignorance then knowledge; and ſo <hi>Hierom</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe confeſſeth, that he was ignorant of more truths then he did underſtand. In the memory there is more forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe then retention of good; thou forgetteſt more good then thou doeſt remember; <note place="margin">Heb. 2.1.</note> the beſt man alive doth not remember ſo much of a Sermon as he doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get. And therefore the Apoſtle gives this counſell, that we ſhould give the more earneſt heed to thoſe things which we have heard, leſt we let them ſlip as a broken and leaking veſſel runs out; for the word ſignifies, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is a metaphor taken from leak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing veſſels. And ſo likewiſe in the fancy there are more vain ſinful, and unclean ſpeculations, then there are divine and holy contemplations. In the affections there is more love to earthly things then to heavenly; thou more feareſt man then God, and grieveſt more for affliction then ſin; for the puniſhment more then for the evill of ſin; if you ranſack all men, you ſhall finde more corruption of nature, then holineſſe and grace in them, <note place="margin">Gal. 5.19,20.</note> this the Apoſtle hints in that catalogue which he gives of the works of the fleſh, and the fruits of the Spirit, where he reckons up ſeventeen ſins, and but ſeven graces; to note that there is more ſinne then grace in men. Corruption it is like great <hi>Goliah,</hi> and grace is but like little <hi>David;</hi> but yet though corruption be ſtrong, &amp; there be more of it in us then grace, yet we ſhall get the victory in the cloſe; though <hi>Goliah</hi> be ſtronger then
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:115133:102"/>
                     <hi>David,</hi> yet as <hi>David,</hi> ſo all the regenerate ſhall have the final ſucceſſe and conqueſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That you may be humbled, conſider that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of nature to grace, it works unweariedly in you; if this contrariety did ſhew it ſelfe now and then, upon ſome extraordinary occaſion, it were not ſo much; but this corruption it works unweariedly againſt grace; grace and good motions are ſupernatural, and therefore are ſometimes irkſome to us that are fleſh and blood: but corrupt motions to ſinne they are natural to a man, and things which act naturally, act unweariedly; as the Sea, it's never weary of flowing, nor the Sunne of running its courſe; and as the fire is never weary of burning: ſo neither is corrupt nature of oppoſing the holy Spirit; our whole courſe and way to heaven is up the hill, and againſt the tide and winde, both of corruptions and temptations.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be humbled alſo on this ground, that this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of nature it will work continually againſt grace, even to thy dying day; if it did but oppoſe ſometimes, and then would be weary, or elſe if it were ſtinted to ſome age of a mans life, it were ſomething; but this corruption will ſhew it ſelf contrary to grace; as long as thou liveſt, thou mayeſt get rid of actual ſin, but thou canſt never rid thy heart of this habitual corrupt nature. It is a notable ſaying of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> to this purpoſe; It is more (ſayes he) to take away one ſin, then many ſins; his meaning is this, that it is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to take away this one ſin of nature, then to take away many ſins of life; as for actual ſins, the ſinnes thou waſt haunted with the laſt year, thou mayeſt not be troubled with them now, nor the ſins that now thou art troubled with hereafter; but the ſin of thy nature, it hath troubled thee the laſt year, and this year alſo, and it will do all thy dayes; that as Ivy in a wall, though you lop off the branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, yet it is ſo faſtened in the joints and intrals of the wall, that till you pluck down the wall, you cannot root up the the Ivy; ſo it is with us, till God pull down this wall of your body, the root of your ſin cannot be plucked up.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115133:102"/>This was typified under the Levitical Law, <note place="margin">Lev. 14.41,45.</note> in that houſe which was infected with a fretting Leproſie, all their ſcraping and pouring out of the duſt thereof, could not make the houſe clean, and therefore God commanded that the houſe ſhould be pulled down and be remov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d: The corruption of our natures is like this Leproſy, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the pulling down of the wall of the houſe would remedy: ſo nothing but the death of the body will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly deſtroy the body of death. This leprous houſe is a type of thy defiled body, and the ſcraping thereof, an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of thy indeavour to ſweep thy heart of ſin, and yet for all this, the houſe could not be cleanſed till it was pulled down: neither can the houſe of thy body be wholly purified, and ſin quite extirpated, untill it be pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down and laid in the duſt. I remember a learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, <note place="margin">Luke 23.40.</note> he makes the impenitent thief on the Croſſe an embleme of the ſin of our natures, when he was nailed to the Croſſe, and (as we ſay) bound hand and foot, he had onely one member untied, and that was his tongue, and with that he falls a reviling on Jeſus Chriſt; juſt ſo, ſayes this Authour, are our natures, when a man lies on his death-bed, and cannot ſtirre hand nor foot, even then hath he a nature kindled with fire from hell, wherewith he ſinnes againſt God; Oh let this greatly humble us in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Conſider that this contrariety in thy nature againſt grace, though it be repugnant to grace, yet it is ſuitable to thy nature. Corrupt nature will tempt men to thoſe ſins which are moſt ſuitable to fleſh and blood; as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil when he tempted Chriſt in the wilderneſſe being an hungry, <hi>Command,</hi> ſayes he, <note place="margin">Matth. 4.3.</note> 
                     <hi>that theſe ſtones be made bread;</hi> this was a very ſuitable temptation to Chriſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, for he had faſted fourty dayes and fourty nights and was hungry, the devil did ſuit him with a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if the devil do ſuit temptations to our condition, our natures will much more, becauſe a mans owne heart knowes what is more ſuitable to his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115133:103"/>then the devil doth; it is true, the devil knowes what a mans inclination is by his actions, otherwiſe he cannot know; but our natures are ſo corrupted, that they will propoſe temptations that are moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to fleſh and blood; and to thoſe ſinnes which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by cuſtome or inclination we are moſt inclined to. And this the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeakes of, as I have formerly noted; <note place="margin">Jam. 1.14. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  <p n="6">6. Be humbled on this ground, that thy corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will carry thee to commit ſuch ſinnes, which thou didſt believe in thy heart thou ſhouldſt never fall into; an eminent example hereof we have in <hi>Hazael,</hi> who when he was told by the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> what evil he ſhould do unto the children of <hi>Iſrael: That he ſhould ſet their ſtrong holds on fire, and ſlay their young men with the ſword, daſh their children againſt the ſtones, and rip up women with childe; Oh,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>is thy ſervant a dog, that he ſhould do theſe things?</hi>

There is ignorance in thy underſtanding, forgetfulneſſe in thy memory, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe in thy will, diſorder in thy affections, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in thy heart, ſearedneſſe in thy conſcience; now it is true, though every faculty be infected, yet alſo is every part regenerated too in thoſe that are godly. Corruption it is in the ſoule, as the ſoul is in the body; the whole ſoul is in the whole body, and the whole ſoul is in every part of the body; juſt ſo it is with original corruption, it is whole in every man, and it is whole in every part of a man.</p>

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115133:105"/>ſignal thereof, that God ſhould work grace in thee when thou hadſt ſuch a contrariety in thy heart againſt it, this is great mercy; though thou haſt a contrary principle in thy nature to grace, yet converting grace will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; and though it do not remove, yet it will ſubdue corruption; and grace though it be oppoſed, yet it ſhall never be expelled; grace ſhall be conquerer at laſt, though it be alwayes fighting, whileſt we are in this life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God is pleaſed to leave ſuch a contrariety againſt grace, even in the hearts of regenerate men, that they might put a higher eſtimation on Jeſus Chriſt. If you had not had a contrary principle to grace, you would onely have admired God as a Creator; but now having a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſinne within you, you come to ſee the need you ſtand in of a Mediator. <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency needed not a Saviour, but now thou being fallen by ſin, and having a principle of enmity in thy nature, nothing but the power of a Saviour can take away this enmity by the work of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and nothing but a Saviour can free thee from the guilt of this enmity, even Jeſus Chriſt; as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <note place="margin">Rom. 7.24,25.</note> 
                     <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt that hath deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me from this body of death;</hi> it is he by whom thou art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from this guilt and enmity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lord leaves this corruption of nature in the hearts of his people, to ſtirre up in them a greater and deeper meaſure of humiliation. Humiliation, it had not been a duty in us, if the Lord had not left the remainers of original corruption in the hearts of his choſen: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thou ſhouldeſt have delighted in God to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but thou ſhouldeſt not have had this ground of humiliation, if ſinne had been totally extirpated. This was <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.7.</note> an eminent Apoſtle; <hi>There was given him a thorn in the fleſh, a meſſenger of Satan to buffet him, leſt he ſhould be exalted above meaſure.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>There are foure interpretations given of theſe words, ſome referre this thorn in the fleſh to be meant of <hi>Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> which did vex <hi>Paul</hi> ſo; but this is 
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115133:105"/>groundleſſe. Others referre it to ſome exquiſite bodily diſeaſe; but that can harldy be proved. <note place="margin">

Cypr.</note> Others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it to the particular ſinne of luſt of uncleanneſſe; but that cannot be admitted, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> had the gift of continency, and wiſhed that all men were as himſelf, as to that particular. But here by the thorne in the fleſh. the moſt inquiſitive and exquiſite Interpreters underſtand it to be the ſin of nature; and it is called a meſſenger of Satan, becauſe the devil doth joyn with mans nature, and doth ſet on the corruption of mans heart; Now why was this thorn in the fleſh left in <hi>Paul?</hi> was it not to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him, leſt he ſhould be exalted above meaſure? <note place="margin">Deut. 8.15,16.</note> 
                     <hi>Thus the Lord left the fiery ſcorpions in the wilderneſſe, to humble the Iſraelites;</hi> and the Lord leaves corruption in thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to humble thee, that thou mighteſt not be puffed up in thy ſelfe, but that when thou perceiveſt the corrupt workings of thy nature, thou mayeſt be the more vile and baſe in thine own eyes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Lord leaves this corrupt nature in thee for the exerciſe of thy grace. Grace is never more exerciſed, then when it is oppoſed; hereby God will try the truth of thy grace, and the honeſty of thy heart, whether thou wilt fall in with the Spirit, and ſide with it againſt the fleſh. Thus the Lord left the <hi>Canaanites</hi> in the land, to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would joyn with them; there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary principle to grace left in us, to try whether we will joyn with the fleſh, or follow the motions and dictates of the Lords Spirit.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall name three reaſons; that though it be true, you cannot remove the contrariety that is in your hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt grace, yet there is juſt reaſon why you ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a conteſt againſt it.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:115133:106"/>1. If you will not oppoſe corruption of nature, it will break forth with greater rage and violence in your lives; thou haſt now an unclean nature, but if thou doſt not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, thou wilt have a vicious life: let but thy nature alone, and it will be like a field unmanured, over-runne with briars and thornes; <hi>Out of the heart proceed evill thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornication, thefts, falſe witneſſe, blaſphemies;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 15.19</note> if we ſtifle not evil thoughts in the heart, they will break out you ſee into evill and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate practices of life; ſo that herein though you cannot remove original corruption, yet if you do not oppoſe it, you will not only have it in your hearts, but alſo viſible in your lives.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though you cannot remove and deſtroy this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of nature, yet you may be able to ſuppreſſe it; it is true, deſtroy it you cannot, but weaken it you may; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it you cannot, but repreſſe it you may: You may do with it as <hi>Joſhua</hi> did by the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> he ſaved their lives, but made them hewers of wood and drawers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> they did not throw them out, but made them tributaries, ſo though thou canſt not drive out corruption of nature, yet thou mayeſt keep it under; and the more thou doſt conteſt with thy corrupt heart, the more thou wilt be able to keep i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as long

Though our grace in this life will never be ſo ſtrong as to expell and utterly ſubdue our corruption, yet by our ſtriving and labouring to keep up this conteſt, thou wilt keep thy corruption at ſuch an under, as it ſhall never extinguiſh grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider, that not to conflict with thy corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is an argument that thou haſt no grace in thee. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one there is no oppoſition; oppoſition muſt be betweeen two: <hi>Theſe are contaary the one to the other;</hi> as corrupt nature is contrary to grace, ſo grace is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to corrupt nature; and therefore if thou doeſt lie ſtill, and not conflict with corruption, it is an evident argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thou haſt no grace.</p>

                     </note> make us ever watchful and jealous over our own hearts, you know not how farre the contrariety and corruption of your hearts may carry you before you die; do not think, ſurely I ſhall never fall into ſuch a ſin, and ſuch a ſin; be not ſecure, thou haſt a nature in thee that may prompt thee to the worſt ſin, that ever was commited upon the earth. I told you of an obſervation of Mr. <hi>Capels,</hi> that a Chriſtian before he died, ſhould be tempted to break eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Commandment of the Law, and to doubt of every Article in the Creed; thou haſt a contrariety againſt all grace, and therefore an inclination to all ſin; carry therefore a jealous eye over thy ſelfe: <hi>Peter</hi> he was not ſuſpicious enough of himſelfe, when he told Chriſt, <hi>That though all ſhould forſake him, yet he would not; Nay,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>though I die with thee, yet I will not deny thee;</hi> and yet <hi>Peter</hi> he did both, he forſook him, and denied him, <note place="margin">Matth. 26.35.</note> and that with a curſe and an oath. Had <hi>Peter</hi> known his own heart, he would never have ſaid ſo. Good men know not to what the corruption of their natures may carry them; it may be thou art a holy and a gracious Chriſtian, thou walkeſt unblameably in the place where thou liveſt; but
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115133:107"/>conſider, if God ſhould let thy nature looſe, with what impetuous violence wilt thou be drawne to ſin? <hi>Hazael,</hi> as I noted before, thought not that there was that wickedneſſe in his heart, which the Prophet foretold him of, <note place="margin">2 Kings 8.13.</note> and therefore ſayes he, <hi>Is thy ſervant a dog, that he ſhould do this wickedneſſe?</hi> Nay, Chriſt himſelfe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warnes his diſciples, <note place="margin">Luke 21.34.</note>

As in the firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all creatures were ſeminally in the <hi>Chaos,</hi> and there wanted onely the motion of the Spirit to bring them forth; ſo in our natures there is the ſeed of all evil, and there wants but occaſion and temptation to draw it forth.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Direction </seg>2</label> though there be this contrariety in thy heart againſt grace, yet be not diſcouraged: though thou diſcerneſt this corruption in thy nature more then ever thou didſt in all thy life-time paſt, yet be not diſhearten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: there are many godly ſoules in this caſe, who never ſaw more corruption, nor more violence then now they do; they thought ſin was dead, but now they ſee it alive; they thought the power of it was weakened, but now they ſee the edge of it ſharpened. There are theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, why ſuch ſhould not be diſcouraged.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe it may proceed, not from an increaſe of ſin in thy nature, but from a clearer diſcovery of ſinne; not that the object is multiplied and greatened, but becauſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115133:107"/>thy ſight is cleared; a godly man he ſees more corruption in his nature then ever he ſaw before: this proceeds not becauſe there is more corruption then indeed was before, but becauſe the Lord hath given him a clearer inſpection into his own heart. I may illuſtrate it by this compariſon. In a dark and gloomy day, you ſee no duſt, nor motes flying up and down your chamber; but let the bright beames of the Sunne ſhine in there, and then you ſee abundance of duſt: now the duſt was there before, but you ſaw it not, becauſe the Sunne made it not appear to you; thus it is with men: Before converſion they have an abundance of luſts in their hearts, but they ſee them not, becauſe the Sunne of righteouſneſſe hath not ſhined into them.—You have a notable paſſage of <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. <note place="margin">Rom. 7.13.</note>

                  <p n="2">2. It may proceed from a more gracious and tender ſincerity in thy conſcience, then there was in times paſt. In former time thy conſcience was hard, ſeared, and ſenſeleſſe, fighting againſt the ſenſe of ſinne, but now God hath melted and mollified it; God hath made thy conſcience to be not as ſeared, but as raw fleſh: godly men may complain of corruption, and think they have more then ever they had, but it is becauſe they are more tender, and more ſenſible. When a man hath hurt his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he thinks he doth never ſo much touch it as then, and this ariſeth from the tenderneſſe of the part, ſo God having made thy heart a broken and a ſoft heart: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the corruption of thy heart is more felt then before. <note place="margin">Prov. 7.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thou doſt not ſin, becauſe the devill tempts thee, nor becauſe thou art in bad company, but becauſe thou haſt a corrupt nature. It is a ſaying of a learned Divine, that a Chriſtian hath many enemies to fight withall, but he hath onely one which overcomes grace, and that is the fleſh. Were it not for corruption within, all temptations would be no other to thee, then they were unto Chriſt; the Tempter came to him, but he found nothing in him; his temptations were but as a ſpark of fire caſt into the ſea: but the devil comes to thee, and the world comes to thee, and they find fit matter in thee, a ſuitablenes in thy nature to fall into and cloſe with the temptation; and therefore reduce actual ſin to its original; thus <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>It is no more I that ſins,</hi> ſayes he, but who doth he blame? <note place="margin">Rom 7.20.</note> not the devil, nor the world, <hi>but ſin that dwelleth in me;</hi> that is, an evill and corrupt nature; it is my corrrupt nature which drawes me to evill, and hinders me from good; and if you would thus reduce your ſinne to its original, what cauſe of ſorrow and debaſement would it give unto you?

Complain not of the evill that is in thy life, but charge it upon thy corrupt nature; and thus alſo <hi>David</hi> in another place, <note place="margin">Iſai. 48.8.</note> he duces thoſe two great evils of murther and adultery to the corruption of his nature; and ſayes he, <hi>I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me.</hi> And thus <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his <hi>Confeſſions,</hi>

                     </label> That the corruption of the fleſh, even in regenerate men, doth oftentimes divert them from, and diſturb and interrupt them in their holy performances.</p>
                  <p>To confirm this point, you have not only the teſtimony 
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:115133:110"/>of the Apoſtle, that it was ſo with other men, but alſo his own experience, <note place="margin">Rom. 8 18.

                  <p>I ſhall branch out this Doctrine into two parts, and ſhall ſhew that this corruption of nature in reference to good, hath a double miſchievous conſequence, or effect.

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are the particulars I ſhall inſiſt upon, and ſhall now begin with the firſt, <hi>That corrupt nature hinders a man from the doing of good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To illuſtrate this, there is a fit embleme in that Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mentioned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. concerning <hi>Tamar,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 38.27,28</note> who had twins in her womb, <hi>Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zarah;</hi> now the Hiſtory mentions that <hi>Zarah</hi> did firſt put out the hand, and the Midwife tied a ſcarlet thred about his finger, but <hi>Pharez</hi> ſtrugled with <hi>Zarah,</hi> and ſo got out firſt. Divines accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate this Hiſtory to this purpoſe, that a godly man may like <hi>Zarnh</hi> ſet on for the doing of duty, but corrupt nature like <hi>Pharez</hi> hinders the birth of <hi>Zarah.</hi> Corrupt nature hinders regenerate men from doing of good.</p>
                  <p>That which I ſhall now do, ſhall be to ſhew you what are thoſe politick devices of mans nature, that hinder him from the doing of good; and there are theſe twelve ſtratagems which corrupt nature uſes to this end.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The fleſh hinders us from doing of good, by perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a man that he is above the uſe of duty; this is a ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion which comes from proud fantaſtical nature; Duties ſaith the fooliſh Familiſt, they are but fleſhly formes, and but for the inferiour rank of Chriſtians, not for thoſe that are growne up to a tall ſtature, and are people of a higher diſpenſation. Corruption doth often make this plea, for the neglect of the uſe of duty; and this was ſeen to work in the dayes of the Apoſtles, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Are there not contentions among you,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.12.</note> ſayes he, <hi>whileſt every one of you ſay I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I of</hi> Apollo, <hi>I of</hi> Cephas, <hi>and I
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115133:110"/>am of Chriſt;</hi> here the Apoſtle doth not only blame them that cried up parties among the Apoſtles, but condemnes a fourth ſort alſo, which ſaid they were of Chriſt, and why ſhould the Apoſtle condemne ſuch? why, the meaning is this: the Apoſtle condemnes Enthuſiaſme; theſe were ſo farre from crying up <hi>Paul,</hi> or other of the Apoſtles, that they were all for Chriſt; that is, they were for Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Inſpirations; now the Apoſtle condemnes thoſe that ſo cry up Chriſt, as to decry an ordinary Miniſtery. And to antidote you againſt this infection of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I ſhall give you theſe three particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That in the moſt glorious times of the Church, the Word hath promiſed that duties and Ordinances ſhall be of uſe among Believers; Thus S. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. <note place="margin">Revel. 11.15. <hi>compared with verſe</hi> 19.</note> The ſeventh Angel ſounded, and there were great voices in heaven, <hi>ſaying, The Kingdomes of this world are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Kingdomes of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign for ever and ever;</hi> and in the nineteenth verſe it followes, <hi>The Temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was ſate in his Temple the Ark of his Teſtament;</hi> That is, there was to be Goſpel-Ordinances even in the pureſt times of Gods Church, after Antichriſt ſhould be deſtroyed; yet then there ſhould be a Temple, and within it the Ark of Gods Teſtament, meaning Goſpel-Ordinances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Scripture tells you that the ſtrongeſt Chriſtians are to be converſant in the duties of Religion; and thus the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 15.14,15.</note> he tells them that he was perſwaded that they were full of goodneſſe, filled with all knowledge, able alſo to admoniſh one another; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, ſayes he, I am bold to put you in minde, as if he ſhould ſay, though you are full of knowledge and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet I muſt put you in minde of your duty. The ſtrong had need to be exerciſed in duties and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancs,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To have their judgements confirmed in knowledge, and belief of the truth, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.21. I have not written to you, becauſe you know not, but becauſe you know the truth.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:115133:111"/>2. To have their memories ſtrengthened in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the truth, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. <hi>I will put you in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, though you once knew this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. To have their affections more excited to the love of the truth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Untill you come to heaven, you muſt be converſant in the uſe of duty. You read of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that all the while they were in the wildernes, the Lord ſent them Manna from heaven, but when once they came to <hi>Canaan,</hi> then Manna ceaſed; ſo whileſt you are in the wilderneſſe of this world, you muſt be fed with the Manna of Ordinances, but when you come to heaven, then, and not till then will Ordinances ceaſe; only the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had no Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">Rev. 21.22,23.</note> 
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.22,23. And therefore the more abominably unthankful are all they who make no other uſe of their ſo long living under Ordinances, but proudly to profeſſe themſelves above Ordinances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another ſtratagem which corrupt nature hath, is a pretence of urgent and extraordinary affaires and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the world, and this ſome will make a hinderance to duty. They will tell you that their conditions are neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and that they have time little enough to follow their callings, and therefore they hope God will diſpenſe with them, though they be not ſo much in duty as other men. Such as theſe were they who were bidden to that great Supper mentioned by <hi>Luke,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 14.18, <hi>to</hi> 26.</note> who with one conſent began to make excuſe, <hi>One had bought a piece of ground, and he muſt needs go and ſee it, another a yoke of Oxen, and he must go and prove them, and another married a wife, and he could not come;</hi> Such pretences as theſe are found in corrupt nature, to make callings in the world to be a diſpenſation to duty to God; and that I may take off this miſtake, I ſhall lay down theſe three particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God never ordained our particular callings as men, to juſtle out our general callings as we are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or that civil duties ſhould juſtle out Divine duties. A wiſe management of, and forecaſt in your worldly
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115133:111"/>affaires, would give you time enough to ſet about divine duties; a holy prudence and providence will redeem time for prayer, hearing, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider that the way for God to bleſſe you in your outward callings, is to be much imployed in religious duties. It is the ſaying of one that had but two acres of ground, and a rich Lords land was by his; the poor mans was fruitful, and the Lords was barren; whereupon the Lord came to him, and ask't him the reaſon: Oh Sir, ſayes he, I water my little ground with prayers and teares every morning, this is the way to be bleſſed in the world: <note place="margin">Pſal. 34.10. Mat. 6.33. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> give God his due, and he will give you yours. <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdome of God and his righteouſneſſe, and then all other things ſhall be given in unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thou ſayeſt thou muſt follow thy calling, and ſo neglecteſt thy duty to God; conſider that for this, God may be provoked to blaſt thy outward imployments; without Gods bleſſing it is in vain, <hi>to riſe up early, and to ſit down late, and to eat the bread of ſorrowes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 127.2.</note> as the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> ſpeaks. God doth many times curſe thy outward condition, becauſe thou denieſt him duties of religious worſhip.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And laſtly, God was angry with <hi>Moſes</hi> for neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duty, and with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> alſo, though they had more urgent affaires to plead, then all you have. <hi>Moſes,</hi> though he were in a journey, and one would have thought, that might have been a good excuſe for him, for the not circumciſing of his childe; and yet the Lord was ſo diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at this neglect of his, that he met him in his Inne, <note place="margin">Exod. 4.24.</note> and had like to have killed him. God would not diſpenſe with the neglect of his Ordinance, though the neceſſity of a journey might have pleaded an excuſe for <hi>Moſes.</hi> So the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whileſt they were in the wilderneſſe, God was angry with them, becauſe they neglected this Ordinance of circumciſion, and yet they might have plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for themſelves, that they were moving from place to place, pitching their Tents now here, now there; and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115133:112"/>though this pretence may ſeem very fair, <note place="margin">Joſh. 5.5,6.</note> yet God was not pleaſed with them; which may teach us that it is not our worldly imployments, nor neceſſary affaires in the world, that can give us a diſpenſation in the performance of our duty to God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another ſtratagem of corrupt nature in this point is this: <note place="margin">Semper incipio vivere.</note> That a man will purpoſe, and promiſe to do du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but not till his preſent eſtate and condition is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; when a man ſhall ſit down and ſay, If I were in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condition, God ſhould have more duty and ſervice from me, then now he hath; but in this condition that I am now in, I have not time nor opportunity.—This is a moſt plauſible ſtratagem, whereby your corrupt hearts labour to take you off from duty. Suppoſe thou art a young man, and a ſervant, thy heart will ſuggeſt unto thee thus: but if thou wert then a Maſter, Oh how many houres wouldeſt thou ſpend in Gods ſervice? thou art a poor man, and thou ſayeſt, Oh if I were a rich man, how liberal would I be? Thou art a private man, but if thou wert a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, what good wouldeſt thou do, this was <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s vain conceit. But remember this, if thy condition ſhould be changed, and thy heart remain unchanged, thou wouldſt ſtill be the ſame man, though thy condition were altered; and to you that have been, or may be thus deceived by your deceitfull hearts, I would lay down theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Know that it is a meer deceit of heart, to think that if thy condition were changed, thou wouldeſt be a changed man; it appeares to be a deceit upon this ground, becauſe if thou art not good in thy preſent condition, thou canſt not be good in any condition, if thy heart be the ſame; and the reaſon is, it is thy naughty heart which makes thee bad in thy preſent condition, <note place="margin">Coelum non animum mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat.</note> and if that continues with thee, thou wilt be bad in another condition; if thou art a bad ſervant, thou wilt be a bad Maſter, and if a bad childe, thou wilt be a bad father; if thou art not good in a ſingle condition, thou wilt not be good in a married eſtate,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115133:112"/>unleſſe thy heart be changed: if thy heart be not changed, thy lifee will not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider that every other condition which thou doſt ſo admire, and deſire after, it hath peradventure more ſnares, more incumbrances and inconveniences, then the preſent condition thou complaineſt of; thou art now a young man, and thou complaineſt that thou haſt not time to pray, what wouldeſt thou do, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.34.</note> if thou hadſt the charge of a houſe and family? a publick condition hath more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions and encumbrances then any private condition, and therefore do not deceive your ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another ſtratagem of corrupt nature to keep a man from duty, is by putting a foule vizard upon the beautiful face of religious duties. Juſt as the fleſh to provoke a man to ſin, will ſmear over ſin, and make it appear like the beautiful face of grace: ſo the heart on the other ſide, to keep a man from duty, will ſmear over the beautiful face of godlineſſe, with carnal prejudices; even as <hi>Judas</hi> did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage that moſt excellent and memorable act of <hi>Mary</hi> in that honourable liberality ſhe ſhewed unto Chriſt in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the boxe of ointment, as a profuſe and riotous waſte, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.8. So thy corrupt heart will ſuggeſt to thee, what is zeal for God, but raſhneſſe and indiſcretion? and what is holineſſe, but baſeneſſe of minde? what is pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not to give injury for injury; but a ſordid temper? and what is walking with God, but a Monkiſh kinde of life? what is a conſciencious care to ſanctify a Sabbath? it is but <hi>Judaiſme;</hi> and what is it to be of a tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but to have a needleſſe ſcrupuloſity? By this meanes, men allowing their corrupt hearts to argue thus carnally, they are hindred from much good; and therefore if thou wouldeſt be taken off from this deceit, thou muſt labour to ſee the native luſtre and beauty that is in holineſſe, and the filthineſſe of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another way whereby the heart of man deceives him, is by pretence to do ſome leſſer good, and thereby neglect the doing of a greater; and thus the devil and a
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115133:113"/>mans own heart diverts him many a time. It is an obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. <hi>Greenham,</hi> that in many families, every triſling buſineſſe ſhall hinder prayer; and this is the nature of a mans heart, to make every ſlight buſineſſe to divert him from duty, and the exerciſes of religion. Thus it was with the Phariſees, <note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>They would tithe Mint Anniſe and Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> and ſo neglect righteouſneſſe, and the more ſerious and weighty things of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Many men will content themſelves to read a Chapter at home, and neglect the Miniſtery of the Word, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in publick; this is meerly the ſly deceit of a mans own heart, even as the ancient hereticks called <hi>Euchitae,</hi> they were ſo intent on prayer, as that they neglected all other ſervice of God.</p>
                  <p>To this I would only ſay, that thoſe who make one du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to juſtle out another, let ſuch remember that duties are not contrary, but ſubordinate and ſubſervient one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I may ſay of the duties of religion, as the Scripture ſpeaks of the Lamps of the Sanctuary; they were ſo ſeated, that one lamp ſhould kindle another: ſo duties they are ſo ordered by God, that one duty ſhall help another, and fit for another; prayer fits for hearing, hearing fits a man for meditation, and meditation fits for prayer, and ſo of all other duties; and therefore they which make one duty to hinder another, they make thoſe things contrariant, which the Lord hath made concordant.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Another ſtratagem which the fleſh uſeth is this, that if it cannot perſwade men wholly to neglect duty, yet it will endeavour to make them abate in duty. It may be thy corrupt heart cannot prevaile with thee to caſt off prayer, and hearing the Word, ſo as never to perform theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yet will it labour to gain thus much upon thee, that thou ſhalt pray more ſeldome then thou haſt done, and hear not ſo often as formerly thou haſt done. As it is a deceit of the heart to bring us from ſmall ſins to great ſins; ſo alſo is it the policy of the fleſh, from the doing of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſeldom, at laſt to bring us not to do it at all.—And to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115133:113"/>antidote you againſt this infection of nature, I ſhall lay down theſe following conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is the policy of thy heart, not to make thee caſt off duty wholly, and at once, but to make thee abate gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually; <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.4. The Church at <hi>Epheſus</hi> did gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally decay, firſt left off her firſt love, and afterwards her firſt works; and the reaſon is, becauſe hereby thy heart and the devil knowes, that abatements when they are gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, they are leſſe ſenſible; but neglects when they are total, they fall under the cognizance of a natural conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: You muſt pray ſometimes, and hear ſometimes, elſe conſcience will check a man; but gradual decayes they are not ſo ſenſibly perceived, and therefore the devill and thy own heart will let thee pray, and will let thee hear, but not ſo much as formerly thou haſt done; this is a ſnar, which many of Gods people have been taken in.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider that the ſoule is in as much danger by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual decayes and abatements, as by total omiſſions. A leake in a ſhip though but ſmall, will at laſt as certainly, and more dangerouſly, becauſe more inſenſibly and unperceivingly cauſe the ſhip to miſcarry, as a violent ſtorme. Lingring conſumptions do kill men, as ſurely as violent burning fevers; it is true, a fever or the plague may kill a man in three dayes, but a conſumption will as certainly bring a man to his end, and to his grave.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Corrupt nature will ſuggeſt to thee that thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt leave off duty, becauſe of the unalterable decree of God. Corrupt nature will tell thee, that if thou art ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to damnation, all thy praying and all thy hearing will never ſave thee; and if thou art ordained to ſalvation, though thou doeſt not hear ſo much, and pray ſo much, it ſhall not procure thy eternal damnation; this deceit is rooted in the hearts of all the ſonnes of men: and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thereto, I have onely theſe three things to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to duty, you are not to conſult with Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret decrees, but with his revealed Word; <hi>Secret things 
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115133:114"/>belong to the Lord our God, but revealed things to us and our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 29.29.</note> We are not to look to the decrees of God, and upon them, either do or not do our duty; but we are to look to his revealed will, which bids us be converſant in holy duties of religion and godlineſſe; we are not to ſearch the ſecret records of heaven, but the Scriptures. It was a good ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of holy Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> A man ſhould not go to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Predeſtination, untill he be well grounded in the Grammar-School of obedience and repentance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider that the ſame decree which determines the end of a man, <note place="margin">Qui deſtinat ad finem, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat ad media.</note> determines alſo the means to bring about that end. If thou art decreed to be damned, the ſame God decrees that thou ſhalt be left to walk in ſuch wayes which lead to damnation; and if thou art decreed to be ſaved, God hath alſo decreed that thou ſhouldeſt walke in thoſe wayes which lead to everlaſting life; and this the Apoſtle tells you. <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.10.</note> 
                     <hi>We are his workmanſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works which God hath before ordained, that we ſhould walk in them;</hi> not onely our happineſſe, but our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe is decreed by God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You which yield to this plea of nature, you will not yield to this plea in other things, you will not reaſon thus in matters of the world; ſhould a man reaſon thus, God hath decreed from all eternity how long I ſhall live in the world, and therefore becauſe the decree is irrevocable, I will neither eat meat nor wear clothes, you would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt this man rather a mad man, then one in his wits. He that refuſeth meat, Gods Ordinance to continue life, is a ſelf-murderer; and he that omitteth duties of Religion out of any pretence of Gods decree, is a ſoul-murderer; as it is thus in nature, ſo alſo is it in grace; as God hath decreed the end, ſo alſo hath he decreed the means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. You will ſay, through the ſuggeſtion of a ſelfe-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving heart, you are unable to perform any good, this is the plea of many, they will ſay, If I were able, I would
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115133:114"/>pray more; if I were able to remember more, I would hear more; but becauſe of my diſability, I am diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from duty. I know this is my my miſery, if I do not read, and hear, and pray; and if I do theſe duties, this is my further miſery, that I ſin in the performance of them. This is natures plea, and in anſwer thereto, conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That thy impotency doth not not nullify thy obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to a moral law. Though thou art unable to perform duty, that doth not free thee from thy tie to duty; thou art bound to do duty, though thou canſt not do it well. If thou haſt loſt ability to obey, ſee thou to that; God hath not loſt authority to command; natural impotency can give no excuſe to wilful neglect.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suppoſe this be true, that thou art unable to do duty, yet conſider that thy ability herein depends upon Gods promiſe, not upon thy own ſtrength; thou art unable, but God is not unable; thou art under a promiſe, do thou ſet upon the performance of duty, and God hath promiſed his Spirits aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider that there is leſſe evill in the performance of a duty, though thou ſinneſt in the manner of doing it, then in a total omiſſion; that man ſinnes leſſe, which prayes, and doth not pray well, then that man which doth not pray at all. Indeed defects in duty they break part of a command; but total neglects, they break the whole command: the duty is eſſential, but the defect is but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Proceed now to lay down ſome other pleas which corrupt nature makes, to divert us from duty. I have layed down eight already; the next in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is this:</p>
                  <p n="9">9. From the auſterity that men perceive in the duties of Religion, what will the fleſh tell a man? If thou devoteſt thy ſelfe to holy exerciſes, <note place="margin">Spiritus <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus,</hi> eſt ſpiritus melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicus.</note> thou doeſt but give thy ſelf to a rigid courſe of life, and thereby abridge thy ſelfe of many lawful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. <hi>Calviniſme,</hi> ſay the Papiſts, makes men melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.—This is a great prejudice to many men, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in the way of holineſſe; and to this I have three things to anſwer:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is not ſo much auſterity in the exerciſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion now under the Goſpel, as there was under the Law. The worſhip under the Law was a very auſtere wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; they were to ſacrifice their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ocks out of the ſtall, and their ſheep out of their flocks; and they were to go out of all the regions of <hi>Judea,</hi> once a year to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip; and ſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks alſo of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115133:115"/>
                     <hi>That it was a yoke, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 15.10.</note> But now for the duties under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God doth not require you to offer your beaſts for a ſacrifice, but rather your luſts. He requires not any thing which is laborious and painful; he requires not the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of your fleſh, but the circumciſion of your hearts. That man which complaines of the auſterity of Goſpel-duties, if he were a Jew, he would then complain much more. Goſpel-Ordinances they are eaſie; Chriſt calls al ſuch as are <hi>weary &amp; heavy-laden</hi> to come to him, <note place="margin">Matth. 11.28,29,30.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp; they ſhall find reſt; and to take his yoke upon them, and to learne of him; for his yoke is eaſie, and his burden is light.</hi> The invitation, is to imbrace the Chriſtian Religion, in oppoſition to the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh religion, which was a heavy yoke: but ſayes Chriſt, <hi>Take my yoke, for it is eaſie;</hi> that is, walk in a Chriſtian courſe, <hi>and you ſhall finde eaſe and reſt to your ſoules.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou which art kept off from the exerciſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, becauſe thou feareſt thereby thou ſhalt be abridged of thy joyes and delights in the world; conſider, that the duties of Religion they will not extirpate, and nullify thy joyes, but only regulate them; not remove, but raiſe your delights. Religion, it is not a mattock to digge up your joyes by the roots, but a pruning-hook to pare and cut off your luxurious branches.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Know that there are none that have more ground of joy, then thoſe who are moſt conſciencious and careful in the performance of the duties of Religion. <note place="margin">Rom. 15.13.</note> 
                     <hi>There is joy and peace to be had in believing, as the Apoſtle tells you;</hi> there is none before, nor none without believing; and as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells you, <hi>Believing ye rejoyce, with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, and full of glory.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.8.</note> It is not ſpoken of the joy which ſhall be in heaven, but of the joy which believers have in this world; love to Jeſus Chriſt, and believing in Jeſus Chriſt, it fills the ſoul with joy and glory in this life. You may tell all the dimenſions of an outward joy; but the joy of a believer, it is a joy unſpeakable, and a joy full of glory.</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:115133:116"/>10. Another plea of corrupt nature is this, that you have done enough already, that you have ſpent ſo many yeares in a courſe of Religion; ſo many yeares you have been a profeſſor, and what need you more? Thus <hi>Jehu</hi> he thought he had done enough in deſtroying <hi>Baal,</hi> and therefore he needed not to put down the Calves. This is a pleawhich many times takes off the heart from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther progreſſe; and I have three things to ſpeak to it.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The people of God in former ages, they never uſed to make this a plea; nay, they have been of a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary temper. <note place="margin">Phil. 3.13,14.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> tells you that <hi>He forgot thoſe things which were behinde,</hi> and <hi>reaching forth to thoſe things</hi> which <hi>are before, I preſſe toward the mark;</hi> that is, I forget all my part paſt duties and performances; I will not reſt contented in them, but I will preſſe forward. If I have done much good, I will do more good; oh therefore be thou as abundant in duty for time to come, as if thou hadſt never been imployed in duty for time paſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Scripture doth make your abounding in duty in former time, to be an argument why you ſhould abound more in after time; haſt thou prayed and heard much formerly? hear more hereafter; this the Apoſtle makes an argument unto the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8 7.</note> that as they had <hi>abounded in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence and love;</hi> ſo alſo, <hi>they ſhould abound in a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contribution to the poor Saints that were</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and ſayes he, as you have <hi>abounded,</hi> ſo <hi>abound in this grace alſo.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Phil. ver. 8,9.</note> And as <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon,</hi> in that Epiſtle ſayes he, Shew mercy to <hi>Oneſimus;</hi> why? for thou haſt ſhewed mercy; thou haſt refreſhed the bowels of the Saints, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh this alſo: ſo that if you have been much in duty, it is an argument that you ſhould be more therein for time to come.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You which plead you have been much in duty for time paſt, and are negligent in that which at preſent you ought to do; you would not reaſon thus in things of this life; where is the man that will ſay thus? I have gotten ſo
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115133:116"/>much money this laſt year, that I will get none this; thus you ſee the unreaſonableneſſe of this plea. Men think they can never enough abound in temporals, but any meaſure of ſpirituals will ſerve the turn, and ſatisfy them.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Another plea of corrupt nature is this. The fleſh will tell you, you have not been ſo much in ſin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you need not be ſo much in duty; we are not men who break out into notorious evils.—This is a cunning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the corruption of mens hearts, and therefore I ſhall ſpeak the more to this plea; and there are five parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which I ſhall lay down by way of anſwer:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This plea ſavours of pride, ſloth, and ignorance: of pride, as if muchneſſe of duty could expiate the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne: it ſavours of much idleneſſe, when the heart will take hold on ſuch poor ſhifts and excuſes to take you off from, or make you neglective in the performance of religious duties; and then it ſavours of much ignorance, as if a man could be much in duty, that is much in ſin; the more thou art in ſin, the leſſe thou art in duty; and if thy duties do not abate thy ſins, thy ſinnes will abate thy duties.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider that the Angels and Saints in heaven, they are not at all guilty of ſin, yet they are much in duty; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in duty, though never in ſinne: ever ſinging praiſes and hallelujahs to God, but never ſin; and our duty is to do the will of God, as it is done in heaven; that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and cheerfully.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider, though thou hadſt leſſe ſin then thou haſt, yet thou haſt more guilt which cleaves to little ſins, then all thy duties can expiate or take away; that man will deceive himſelfe, who thinks to ſet his duty over againſt his ſin by way of expiation, becauſe there guilt and ſin cleaves to our duties.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This which thou makeſt to be a plea, why thou ſhouldeſt not be much in duty, if it be well weighed, will rather prove an argument why thou ſhouldeſt be much in duty: As thus, if thou art not much in ſinne, thou haſt
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115133:117"/>the more cauſe to be much in duty, and to praiſe God that he hath kept thee from thoſe ſins which other men have fallen into; thou haſt cauſe to be much in prayer to God for preventing grace, that thou mayeſt not fall into ſinne for the time to come.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Conſider, that thoſe men who have been leaſt in ſin, the Scripture tells us they have been moſt in duty. <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 1.</note> it is ſaid of him, <hi>that he walked in all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God blameleſs,</hi> and yet the Scripture commends him in this, that he was often in the Temple. And <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Acts 10.2.</note> the Scripture reports him to be a <hi>devout man,</hi> and one that feared God, with all his houſe, who gave <hi>much almes to the poor,</hi> and <hi>prayed to God alway;</hi> though he was a devout and holy man, yet he prayed to God alwayes; he was much in duty, though he was not much in ſin. So it is ſaid of <hi>Anna, Luke</hi> 2.37. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And of the Primitive Church, that they continued in the doctrine of the Apoſtles, &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The fleſh will tell you, that they who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been much in duty, they have now caſt off duty; and you will ſay, Why may not I do ſo too? I ſee thoſe men that formerly were deſirous to hear Sermons, they now hear not; thoſe who prayed much and often formerly, now never pray; thoſe that formerly were much in duty, have now caſt off duty; this is a plea which mans naughty heart takes notice of; and to it I have three things to ſay:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is true, the more is the pity, that many who have formerly much uſed duty, have now caſt off duty; and yet though this be true, do you take heed that you fall not into the ſame ſin &amp; ſame condemnation. The Scripture layes a great blame and blemiſh upon ſuch; there are two Texts to this purpoſe; the one is, in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.10. where the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <note place="margin">Hoſ. 4.10.</note> that they had <hi>left off to take heed unto him;</hi> they did once ſeek after God, and did take heed unto his wayes, but now they had left it off. Another paſſage to this purpoſe alſo you have of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>They have left off to be wiſe,</hi> (ſayes he) and <hi>to do good;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 26.3.</note> they did formerly do much good,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115133:117"/>but now they have left it off; the Scripture brands ſuch men as theſe for wicked Apoſtates.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider, that you would account this a vain plea in other things; you that account this rational in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, you judge irrational in worldly things. If a man ſhould tell you that other men had left off tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and turned bankrupts, and therefore why ſhould not you do ſo too? you would account it very irrational, and ſay, Though other men have played the fooles, and run themſelves out of their eſtates, yet that is no warrant for you to do ſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Know, that thoſe who have been much in duty, and have now caſt it off, if they belong unto God, he will bring them home by weeping croſſe; God will make them ſee their folly, to their ſhame. An example hereof you have in the ſecond of <hi>Hoſ.</hi> ver. 7. <note place="margin">Hoſea 2.7.</note> The Church did there apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatize from God; but, ſayes ſhe, <hi>I will return to my firſt husband, for then was it better with me, then now;</hi> then when I ſerved my God, and walked in his wayes, which now I have gone aſtray from, therefore will I return. This will be the language of all thoſe who have caſt off duty, if they belong unto God.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. This is the plea of ſome, that they abſtain from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of duty, becauſe they would avoid more evill thereby, and this is a cunning inſinuation of the fleſh; and thus as on the one hand men are deceived by their corrupt hearts, to commit ſin, that good may come thereon: ſo on the other hand, <note place="margin">Sunt quidam homines, qui cùm audierint, quòd humiles eſſe debent, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil volunt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcere, putantes ſi aliquid didi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerunt, ſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbos fore. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> in Pſal. 130.</note> their hearts would perſwade them to omit duty, that evill might not come thereon; both the deceits are the deluſions of corrupt nature, and this Papiſts are guilty of; for they under a pretence that the common people ſhould not run into error, detain the reading of the Bible from them. And to this purpoſe <hi>Auſtin</hi> mentions ſome that would not hear the Word, nor get knowledge, upon this pretence, that ſome men have grown proud of their parts and knowledge: to this deceit I ſhall ſay three things:</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:115133:118"/>1. It is a good rule of the Schoolmen, that you muſt not neglect that which is good in it ſelfe, and neceſſary to avoid a ſin, which may be by accident a ſin; for otherwiſe you ſhould never perform duty. If a man will avoid hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſt he ſhould be diſtracted therein, and praying leſt he ſhould have wandring thoughts; by this reaſon a man ſhould never perform duty. Now to hear and to pray, it is good in it ſelfe; but that thou art diſtracted in hearing, or thy minde wandring in praying, this is an accident, and therefore thou muſt not upon a pretence of being guilty of leſſe evill, leave undone thoſe duties, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe men which make this a plea, they will not performe duty, becauſe they ſin in duty; upon the ſame reaſon they may as well ſay, they will not follow their callings in the world, becauſe they ſin in them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this plea, though it be a plauſible one, and doubting Chriſtians are many times intangled therewith, yet by this plea you will not onely be taken off from religious, but civil duties alſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider, that the avoiding of evil upon this pretence, you do thereby run into a greater evill; and the reaſon is, becauſe wilful neglects, and total omiſſions, are greater then ſpiritual defects in the manner of religious perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances; it is a leſſer ſin to be diſtracted in prayer, then not to pray at all. This plea therefore is but a lazy plea of corrupt nature, to make us neglect religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Another plea is a pretence of diſability to perform as we ought. The fleſh will tell you, if thou wert able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form duty better, thou ſhouldeſt be incouraged to do it often; but alas, thou art not able to perform duty; when thou comeſt to hear, thou wanteſt faith to believe the word, and memory to treaſure it up. When tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> comeſt to pray, thou wanteſt a compoſed minde, and thou wanteſt apt expreſſions; and hence the fleſh pleades, that diſability to duty ſhould take a man off from duty. This plea 
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115133:118"/>prevailes with many Chriſtians troubled in conſcience; and in anſwer thereto conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That many Chriſtians which pretend diſability, it may be the reaſon is not diſability, but rather enmity againſt duty, which is the cauſe of their neglect. <note place="margin">Nolle in cauſa eſt, cùm non poſſe praeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur, <hi>Sen. Epiſt.</hi> 116.</note> 
                     <hi>Seneca</hi> hath a paſſage to this purpoſe in one of his Epiſtles, Men, ſayes he, pretend that they are not able to do good, but the true cauſe is, they are not willing; not a diſability in the nature, but an enmity in the heart, which is the cauſe. It is worth your noting, that where the Apoſtle menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a diſability to duty, he there mentions alſo the enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a natural mans heart againſt duty. <hi>The carnal minde,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.7.</note> ſayes he, <hi>is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the law of God, nor indeed can be.</hi> So that thoſe who plead a diſability, they have cauſe to look to their hearts, whether their neglect of duty doth not rather proceed from a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in judgement, rather then a diſability in affection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſtians are apt to make diſability a plea to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect duty, when indeed it is rather the danger that doth attend duty, that keeps them off, then diſability. You have a notable inſtance of this in <hi>Moſes,</hi> a good man, you have the ſtory at large in the fourth of <hi>Exodus.</hi> God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>Moſes</hi> that he ſhould go into <hi>Egypt,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 4.10,13,19.</note> and there to take the care and charge of his people; but what ſayes <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?</hi> Oh, ſayes he, <hi>Wilt thou ſend me to conduct this people? alas, I am not able; I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor ſince thou haſt ſpoken unto thy ſervant; but I am ſlow of ſpeech, and of a ſlow tongue;</hi> this was a plauſible pretence; and therefore in the thirteenth verſe ſayes he, <hi>Lord, I pray, ſend by the hand of him whom thou wilt ſend.</hi> But now was <hi>Moſes</hi> diſability the real cauſe wherefore he would not go? why, no; &amp; therefore in the nineteenth verſe you have there the true reaſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; <hi>Return, ſaith the Lord, into</hi> Egypt, <hi>for all the men are dead which ſought thy life.</hi> There the Lord hints the cauſe; <hi>Moſes</hi> had formerly killed an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> and there was great ſearch made after him. And when God bid <hi>Moſes</hi> go again into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he was afraid; <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not tell God 
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115133:119"/>ſo, but pretends diſability; then the Lord told him shat the <hi>men were dead which ſought his life;</hi> and then the Text ſaith, that <hi>Moſes took his wife and his children, and went down into</hi> Egypt.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Another plea is ſucceſleſſeneſſe in duty; the fleſh will ſuggeſt thus unto thee, What needeſt thou continue in a godly courſe of life? thou haſt made many a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and heard many a Sermon, and yet thou art never the better. To this I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That thou oweſt duty to God as thou art his creature, though he ſhould never give thee ſucceſſe in his ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Duty it ſelfe is ſucceſſe; the very performance is a recompence: if God ſhould never bring thee to heaven, thou haſt in part a recompence, that God ſuffers thee to perform duty to him here: You have <hi>your fruit unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6.20.</note> as the Apoſtle tells you, <hi>and in the end you ſhall have everlaſting life;</hi> holineſſe and duty, they are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of duty</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider, that there is a two-fold ſucceſſe attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant on duty. Firſt, a real ſucceſſe.—Secondly, a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſucceſſe. Sometimes the ſucceſſe is ſenſible, and a mans affections are raiſed, and his luſts ſubdued; but though ſucceſſe may not alwayes be ſenſible, yet it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes reall: a godly man gets real good by all the duties he performes. <note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.8.</note>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115133:119"/>corrupt nature, ſo as to omit good duties. Before ſuch I would lay theſe five conſiderations:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That a man may go to hell for the omiſſions of good duties, as well as for the commiſſions of ſin. Natural conſcience will tel a man that groſs ſinners ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of heaven; but Scripture will tell you alſo, that men ſhall go to hell for the omiſſions of good. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in the ſentence which ſhall be pronounced at the laſt day by the Judge of all the world, that the form of it runnes, not ſo much for commiſſions, as for omiſſions, <note place="margin">Matth. 25.41.</note> that men ſhall be ſentenced for. <hi>Depart from me ye curſed,</hi> ſayes Chriſt: <hi>for I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat; I was was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink; a ſtranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; ſick, and in priſon, and ye viſited me not.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bonum eſt non feciſſe malum, malum eſt non feciſſe bonum.</note> Meerly for omiſſions is the ſentence pronounced againſt them; it may be thou doeſt not die a drunkard, an adulterer, a ſwearer, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, but doeſt thou die a man neglective of good duties? I tell thee, the indictment will be found againſt thee. <note place="margin">Matth. 25.30.</note> It is likewiſe obſerved of the man that had but <hi>one talent,</hi> Chriſt commanded <hi>that he ſhould be caſt into utter darkneſs;</hi> what was the cauſe? he did not imbezzel his Maſters talent, but becauſe he did not improve it, therefore did the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſſe againſt him; and therefore remember you that are omitters of good duty, not for the imbezzelling, or ill uſe of your time, <note place="margin">Matth. 3.10.</note> but for the not improving of it you may go to hell. The tree is threatened to be cut down, not becauſe it brought forth bad fruit, but becauſe it did not bring forth good fruit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider, that the Scripture layes a brand of infamy upon thoſe who do conſtantly neglect the duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; they have <hi>left off to be wiſe, and to do good,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 6.3. Hoſea 4.20.</note> ſaith the Pſalmiſt; and they have <hi>left off to take heed unto the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Hoſea.</hi> But above all, conſider that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy imprecation of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah, Poure out thy fury,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>upon the Heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not upon thy Name.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 10.5</note> And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, 
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115133:120"/>that concerning the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and the <hi>Moabites</hi> is very remarkable, <note place="margin">Deut. 23.3,4.</note> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.3,4. where becauſe of an omiſſion, becauſe they <hi>met not the Iſraelites, and helped them not with bread and water in the way, when they came out of Egypt, they were excommunicated</hi> (as I may ſay) <hi>from the Tabernacle of Gods worſhip, even to the tenth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider, that omiſſions of duty, they do unfit men for duty when they ſhould begin it, and ſet upon it. Keys that are uſed, keep clean; but if they are thrown by, how ſoon do they ruſt? ſo it is with thy heart, thou wilt gather ruſt, if thou throweſt thy duties aſide. Fire, it is not only put out by water, <note place="margin">Prov. 26.20.</note> but by the withdrawing of fuel; <hi>Where no wood is, the fire goeth out:</hi> and therefore remember that if you do not adde fuel to your duty, the heat of your affection will quickly go out. The longer we diſuſe uny duty, the leſſe able are we to do it; as a Scholar, if he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe his ſtudy, he will be the more unfit for that exerciſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God is more diſpleaſed with ſinful, and toral omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of good, then he is with many commiſſions of evill. It is worth your noting, that paſſage concerning <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 4.24.</note> 4.24. God was more angry with <hi>Moſes</hi> there for a ſin of omiſſion, then for any ſin of commiſſion which he had committed all his life. It is ſaid, <hi>The Lord met him in his Inne,</hi> and had <hi>like to have killed him;</hi> what was the matter? why, it was onely this, that he omitted the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of his childe, when he was eight dayes old; this did ſo provoke God, that he ſought to kill <hi>Moſes,</hi> and yet <hi>Moſes</hi> might have had more plauſible pretences for his omiſſion, then we can have for many of the duties which we neglect. I mention this to ſhew you the danger of the ſin of omiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And laſtly, conſider this, that you will not admit of this plea in other things; ſhould your ſervants deal with you thus, when you bid them go about ſuch and ſuch a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and command them to perform ſuch a ſervice, if they are negligent; and when you ſhall call them to an
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115133:120"/>accompt, will you admit of their excuſe, when they ſhall tell you that they do not ſteal your wares out of your ſhops, nor your money out of your Cubboards; we do not do you any injury; will you ſuffer theſe excuſes? why, no certainly: Let me tell you, you are all ſervants to the God of heaven, he is your Maſter; and though you can thus plead, Lord, I am not a groſſe ſinner, I have not diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured thy Name as others have done, and I am no blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer of thy Name; yet God will reckon with you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you call not upon his Name; therefore take heed of omiſſions of good duties, and of all thoſe ſecret inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the fleſh, which lead into this ſinne, and make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes for it.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving formerly ſhewed by what meanes and ways the fleſh labours to <hi>divert</hi> men from duty; I come now to ſhew you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo how it labours to <hi>interrupt</hi> men in duty; and this is a very practical point, and there are many caſes of conſcience, which are incident, and may pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall in in the handling of this particular. But before I come to give you the Queries I intend to handle, I ſhall premiſe theſe ten Concluſions, or Poſitions about the fleſh, its diſturbing good men in good duties.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is this, that the corruption of the fleſh it is more prevalent with good men to diſturb them in, then to divert them from holy duties. Indeed with men unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate corrupt nature prevailes more to divert them from duty; but it is contrary with the regenerate. Godly men are not ſo ſubject to have diverſions from, as diſturbances in holy performances; neglects of duty they fall under the cognizance of a natural conſcience, and therefore good men are not ſo often overcome in that way; but as for diſturbances in duty, they are not taken notice of by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:115133:121"/>2. A godly man is more interrupted in duty by his <hi>own beart,</hi> then he is either by the <hi>devill,</hi> or the <hi>world,</hi> or any thing elſe beſide. We many times blame our callings, and the devil, that he is buſie with us; when we have more cauſe to blame our own naughty hearts. As it is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of good men when they ſin to blame their corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and not the devill, for ſo did <hi>David:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.10.</note> So on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when good men are interrupted in duty, they do not blame the devil or the world ſo much as their own hearts. As the Apoſtle <hi>Pavl</hi> ſayes of himſelfe, <note place="margin">Rom. 7.18.</note> 
                     <hi>To will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good, I finde not;</hi> that is, I finde not ability to be intent and ſerious, in the worſhip of God; but what doth he blame, <note place="margin">Rom. 7.25.</note> not the devill, or the world, but it <hi>is ſin which dwelleth in me.</hi> And in the 25. verſe he ſayes, <hi>With my minde I ſerve the law of God, but with the fleſh, the law of ſin.</hi> It is the fleſh which carries the force of a law, whereby we ſin in the ſervice of God; and therefore, oh man, do not blame the devill, or the world, but thy own heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another Poſition is this, that the corruption of the fleſh interrupting of us in duty, it is manifeſt and violent both in ſecret, as alſo in publick duties; thy heart will be violent againſt thee, when thou art alone, between God and thy own ſoul, as alſo when thou art in publick; your own experience will contribute to the truth of this. What roving mindes, and what diſtracted thoughts are you haunted with in your ſecret retirements? Yea, alſo in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick duties, how hard is it to bound the thoughts, and to compoſe the minde, to lay a reſtraint upon devotion?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That a mans heart, and corrupt nature, is more apt to interrupt him in extraordinary duties, then in common and ordinary duties. A man therefore ſhall be more haunted with evill thoughts upon a ſolemn faſt-day, then upon an ordinary day: did you ever ſet your ſelves upon the ſolemn duties of examination and meditation? if you did, you have found your hearts have more troubled you in thoſe duties, then in reading, hearing, and praying;
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:115133:122"/>and the reaſon is this, becauſe thoſe duties that are more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, are moſt conducible to a Chriſtians growth in grace; and therefore in thoſe duties nature will be moſt indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable, to diſturbe and interrupt you, and the devill will not fail to ſet thy heart at work to diſturb thee in thoſe duties, whereby his Kingdome is battered and aſſaulted,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the leſſe men do prepare their hearts for duty, the more they ſhall be diſturbed by corrupt nature in duty. <hi>Greonham</hi> in his obſervations, takes notice of this: What is the reaſon that Chriſtians can never pray without diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, nor hear without wandring thoughts? Oh man! (ſayes he) take my experience, didſt thou prepare more for duty, thou wouldeſt be leſſe diſtracted in duty. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick doth the body little good if it be taken on a full ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, and if the body be not prepared; ſo it is with du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Ordinances, they will do thee little good, unleſſe thou doeſt firſt prepare thy ſelfe for them.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Poſit. </seg>6</label> 6. That the fleſh interrupts us more in thoſe duties which others perform, then in thoſe which we perform our ſelves. A Preacher when he is preaching a Sermon, he hath leſſe wandring thoughts in preaching, then he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would have if he were a hearer, and why? but becauſe at ſuch a time his minde is buſied in thinking of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath to deliver to his Auditors. And ſo for any of you, ſuppoſe you were praying in a company, you would be leſſe apt to be diſtracted in that duty, becauſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular applauſe, a reſpect to the company among whom you pray, they binde your thoughts, that they runne not aſtray, leſt you ſhould be confuſed in the duty; whereas if you did joyn in duty, then you would be more careleſſe, and diſtracted; and therefore you whoſe lot it is never to preach or pray in publick, do you look to your own hearts; for the fleſh is more apt to interrupt you in thoſe duties, wherein you joyn with others, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n in thoſe which you your ſelfe perform.</p>
                  <p n="7">

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Poſit. </seg>7</label> 7. That in the corruption of the fleſh in duties, it may be more violent after a long ſtanding in Religion, then it
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:115133:122"/>did appear to be upon your firſt converſion. At a mans firſt converſion happily he could pray, and not be diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but have his love, his joy, and his delight, and all his ſoul taken up with the ſervice; but in proceſſe of time, and after ſome continuance in the wayes of Religion, he may begin to grow flat and formal, perfunctory, accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary in all his performances; and this was that which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerved, Many at firſt converſion, they will pray with much feeling and fervency, but afterwards with coldneſſe and deadneſſe, loſing that vigour and warmth of affection, which they found in themſelves at firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Poſit. </seg>8</label> 8. That there is not a duty in all your life-time which you perform unto God, but there is ſome evill tincture of the fleſh cleaves to it; though the duty is good in it ſelf, yet there is ſome evill in it as it comes from thee. Prayer is good, and hearing is good, but theſe duties as they paſſe through the veſſel of thy defiled ſoul, they become defiled; inſo much that God might juſtly charge even upon regenerate men the ſins of their holy duties; <hi>When I would do good,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.15.</note> ſayes <hi>Paul, evill is preſent with me.</hi> It is true, the natural motions of the fleſh may be pared off, but ſtill there is a ſinful tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture which cleaves to thy duties. It is obſervable, that the ceremonial law which you read of, in the 28. of <hi>Exod.</hi> v. 38. <note place="margin">Exod. 28.38.</note> where you read that <hi>Aaron</hi> was to <hi>have a plate of pure gold upon his fore-head, when he went into the holy of holieſt,</hi> that he <hi>mighe bear the iniquity of the holy things of the children of Iſrael.</hi> And this notes, ſayes a Divine, that Jeſus Chriſt our fore-runner, he is gone into the holy of holieſt, and he by his interceſſion, and ſitting at the right hand of his Father, weares that plate of pure gold upon his fore-head, and there beares not onely the iniquity of our lives, but the inquity of our holy things; and if this were not ſo, and did there not a viciouſneſſe cleave unto all our holy duties, then we might commend ſome duties to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt; but becauſe there is no duty can be done without a tincture of evill cleaving to it,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:115133:123"/>therefore you cannot ſtand before God in the beſt prayer that ever you made, nor in the beſt ſervice that ever you performed. We have need of a Chriſt, a Mediatour, not only for our ſins, but alſo for our duties.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Poſit. </seg>9</label> 9. That it is the moſt difficult thing in the world to keep the minde ſo cloſe to duty, that the fleſh ſhall not interrupt you in its performance. As <hi>Eliphaz</hi> reaſoned with <hi>Job,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job. 15.12,13.</note> ſo may every man with his own heart: <hi>Why doth thine heart carry thee away, and what doth thine eyes winke</hi> at, <hi>that thou turneſt thy ſpirit againſt God, and letteſt ſuch words go out of thy mouth?</hi> Thus may every man reaſon with his own ſoule, and ſay, Why doth my heart carry me away, when my ſpirit would keep cloſe to God? <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> hath an excellent note upon 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.27. <note place="margin">2 Sam. 7.27. Dixit ſe inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſe cor ſuum, quaſi ſoleret fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere, &amp; ille ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui quaſi fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivum. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Nihil eſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de meo fugaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. <hi>Bernard. Poſit,</hi> 10.</note> upon <hi>Davids</hi> words, <hi>I have found in my heart</hi> to make a prayer unto thee; as if <hi>David</hi> would intimate, that he often <hi>loſt his heart</hi> in prayer; as if <hi>David</hi> did many times come to pray, but could not finde his heart. It is the hardeſt thing in the world, when you come to pray to finde your hearts, and when you have found your hearts, to keep them,</p>
                  <p n="10">10. That the blood of Jeſus Chriſt wipes off that guilt and filth, that cleaves to your holy duties. God knowes that when you come to worſhip him, you are men, and not Angels; you are the ſpirits of good men imperfect, and therefore God doth not expect from you that your ſervice ſhould be perfect, becauſe your ſtate is imperfect; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here is your comfort, that your defects in duty, ſhall never damne you who are regenerate ſoules; thou mayeſt be often hindred in duty, but that interruption ſhall never damne thee, Jeſus Chriſt wipe off the ſtain of all thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. In the ceremonial law you read that the Altar for the burnt-offering, <note place="margin">Exod. 27.4,5.</note> it had a grate made for it of net-work of braſſe, that the duſt and the aſhes might fall out, and ſo be carried away: This is a type of the interceſſion of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that though in your ſervices and ſacrifices to God, though you have much affection and zeal, yet alſo
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:115133:123"/>there is much aſhes of corruption; and as that grate was made to carry away the aſhes, ſo Jeſus Chriſt he is the Mediatour, which will carry away all your defects in the ſervice of God. And this ſhould incourage the people of God, though you are weak in duty, yet neglect not duty; though you are forgetful in hearing, yet leave not to heare; and though diſtracted in praying, yet neglect not prayer; becauſe it is the office of Jeſus Chriſt to bear the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of your holy things. Theſe are thoſe Poſitions, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, that I deſired to premiſe before I came to handle the Queries. The point that I am to handle is this: <hi>That ſuch is the prevalency of corrupt nature even in regenerate men, that it doth oftentimes interrupt them in holy performances.</hi>

Therefore what cauſe have to complain, as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> when he ſaw a ſhepherd tie a ſtone to the legge of a bird, and the bird aſſaying to fly upwards, was ſtill pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down again by the ſtone: Juſt thus, ſayes he, is it with my ſoule; fain would I ſo are aloft by holy meditation, but there is a ſtone tied to my legge; a corrupt nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I am coutinually pulled down.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> The next Queſtion is, how doth the fleſh hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us in holy performances?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall confine my anſwer to theſe two particulars; there are theſe two wayes how the fleſh doth hinder us in holy duties. 
<list>
                        <item>1. By ſoliciting men to abate, and leſſen their duties.</item>
                        <item>2. By injecting, and caſting in vain and impertinent thoughts.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. By ſoliciting men to abate in their duty; if ſo be nature can prevaile with you to omit duty, or not to be ſo much in duty as thou haſt been heretofore, to pray leſſe, and hear leſſe; herein is a great policy of thy corrupt heart, to perſwade the heart that thou needeſt not be ſo zealous, becauſe remiſſe acts do weaken habits; to pray re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſely, and coldly, will in time bring thee not to pray at all.—Now to thoſe who are thus intangled by the fleſh, that they decay in duty; to ſuch I have three things to ſay.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You have not leſſe need to pray, nor perform du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then in former time, and therefore why ſhould you leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen your duties; you have not leſs temptations from Satan, no leſſe corruptions in thy ſoule, nor fewer ſpiritual wants, no leſſe troubles on the Church; and therefore
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115133:124"/>let not nature prevaile with you to decay in duty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As it is a deceit of the heart in ſinne, to bring you from little ſinnes to great ſinnes: ſo in grace it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of nature, to bring you from doing little in duty, at laſt to do nothing at all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Gradual abatements and decayes in duty, may be as dangerous to thy ſoule, as total omiſſions; and thou mayeſt go to hell as well for the one, as for the other; not but that total neglects do more provoke God. Though a man is in more danger of preſent death, that is ſick <hi>of a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> then he that is ſick of a lingring <hi>conſumption;</hi> yet the one will kill as ſurely as the other. Men that caſt off Religion, they die by a burning fever, but thou which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeſt in Religion, thou mayeſt die of a lingring conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; thou mayeſt conſume and conſume, untill thou comeſt to a meer skeleton in Religion, and to have no verdure, nor vigour in thy ſpirit, in the exerciſes of holineſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. And chiefly, the fleſh interrupts in duty, by injecting and caſting in vain thoughts, and impertinent, when thou art about duty. Now thoſe thoughts which the fleſh caſts in, they are of two ſorts: either ſuch which for the matter of them are lawful, or elſe, which are for their matter unlawful.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <note place="margin">Levit. 28.12. <hi>compared with</hi> Prov. 26.1. <hi>Though it be not</hi> cogitatio mali, <hi>yet it is</hi> cogitatio mala.</note> The fleſh will caſt in thoughts which are for their matter lawful, but onely unſeaſonable; And I may ſay of theſe as the Scripture <hi>ſpeaks of rain;</hi> rain in ſeaſon is a bleſſing; but rain in harveſt is a curſe; ſo good thoughts in their ſeaſon are bleſſed, but a good thought coming into your minde, to divert, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract you in a good work you are about, that thought is ſinful; when you are hearing a Sermon, then to be think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of prayer; and when you are at prayer, then to be thinking of hearing; theſe thoughts are unſeaſonable, and and therefore ſinful. As in Printing, though the letters be never ſo fair, yet if they are miſplaced, they would make non-ſenſe. As that motion, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.13. was lawful:
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115133:125"/>
                     <hi>Maſter, command my brother to divide the inheritance;</hi> but yet it was not ſeaſonable, becauſe it was propounded while Chriſt was preaching.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sometimes again, the fleſh will inject thoughts which are for their matter ſinful; and thus the Prophet complaineth of the <hi>Iſraelites: They come unto thee as the people cometh, and they ſit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them; for with their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetouſneſſe;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 33.31.</note> even in their duties they had ſinful thoughts how to accompliſh their covetous deſires.</p>

                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Quere. </seg>3</label> 3. The third Querie is to ſhew, wherein the prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the fleſh to interrupt us in holy duties, doth appear?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall anſwer this querie by theſe two particulars. 
<list>
                        <item>1. That the fleſh labours to interrupt men in the manner, how they do duty.</item>
                        <item>2. In their ends, why they perform duty. Theſe are the two chief attempts of the fleſh in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The fleſh interrupts a man chiefly in the manner how he performes duty; and there are theſe ſeveral wayes whereby the fleſh hinders a man in the manner of his duty.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The fleſh makes a man perform duty weariedly, without alacrity; <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.12.</note> that as <hi>Solomon ſayes, Much ſtudy it is a wearineſs to the fleſh;</hi> and if much ſtudy, why, then religious exerciſes: when the minde is taken up with them, the devill and a mans own nature are ready to divert and interrupt them, eſpecially a mans nature is apt to be wearied: and hence it is that you have ſuch preſſing perſwaſions, that you <hi>would not be weary of well-doing,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 6.9. 2 Theſ. 3.13.</note> &amp; what is the reaſon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but becauſe of the corruption of a mans heart, which is apt to make him to be tired in holy exerciſes? <note place="margin">Mal. 1.13.</note> Things that act naturally, act unweariedly; and therefore the Sunne is not weary of ſhining, nor the fire weary of burning, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sea of ebbing and flowing, becauſe theſe are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral motions. It is natural to a man to commit ſinne, and therefore the Scripture ſayes, that men are not weary of 
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115133:125"/>committing iniquity; but to do that which is holy, and to act grace in any duty, it is not onely <hi>above,</hi> but <hi>againſt</hi> nature. Hence in Scripture hell it is compared to a pit, and heaven to a hill; now it is an eaſie matter for a childe that can but go, to tumble into a pit, but it is a hard matter to climbe up a hill; you may eaſily fall into the bottomleſs pis, but the way to heaven it is a way up the hill, and hard to get up; and therefore, in the ſecond of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> The mountain of the Lord is ſaid to be eſtabliſhed on the top of the mountaines, and exalted above the hills; and this is, becauſe duties they are againſt nature, 'tis a going againſt winde and tide.</p>
                  <p>I remember a Divine he doth illuſtrate the corruption of a mans heart diſturbing in duty, by a compariſon of a birds being in an egge; while it is in the ſhell it cannot ſtirre, but that bird aſſoon as ever it is hatcht, and the ſhell broken, then it is of a lively motion: thus a man in duty, whileſt he is peſtered with fleſh and blood, he is like a bird in the ſhell, that cannot ſtir; but let once the ſhell be broken; let corruption of nature be ſubdued, and let grace get the upper hand, and then he is as a bird out of the ſhell, that can move and act vigorouſly, and lively in holy duties.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> ſpeaks of thoſe that had wings, and the winde in their wings, <note place="margin">Zech. 5.9.</note> to note the ſwiftneſſe
(as Expoſitors render the ſenſe of that place) and ſpeed that thoſe reformers made; but we in our way to heaven, have neither wings nor winde, naturally going againſt winde and tide, and are glad to <hi>run continually,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12.1.</note> which is apt to make us weary, eſpecially when it is up the hill. Herein the corruption of your hearts appeares, to make you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form duty weariedly. It is as a clogge to hinder us, and therefore the Apoſtle commands us to <hi>lay aſide every weight, and every ſinne that doth ſo eaſily beſet us.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12.1.</note> Corrupt nature it is a weight, and you know if a man run a race with a weight upon him, he will ſoon be tired out.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Corrupt nature makes you perform duty wandring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that as in the Sea one wave followes another, and as
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115133:126"/>in the aire the clouds follow the rain: ſo in the heart, one impertinent thought followes another; the corruption of a mans heart makes him vain in his thoughts. Whileſt thou art, O man, in Gods houſe, the devill is in thy heart as in his work-houſe, forming and framing many contemplative vain thoughts in thy minde, whereby thou art carried away from God. You have a notable paſſage to this purpoſe, if you compare two Scriptures together, and they are both the words of <hi>Solomon:</hi> In <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.14. you read, that <hi>a wiſe mans eyes</hi> are ſaid to be in his head, <note place="margin">Eccleſ 2.14. <hi>compared with</hi> Prov. 17.24.</note> but a fool walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in darkneſs; Now if you look to the natural ſituation of the eye, is it ſcated in the head, as of a wiſe man, ſo alſo of a foole; what then is <hi>Solomons</hi> meaning, when he ſaith, that the eyes of a wiſe man are in his head? his meaning is, that a wiſe mans eyes they are fixed and not wandring; but what is the fooles eye? <hi>Solomon</hi> tells you in <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.24. that <hi>the eyes of a foole are in the ends of the earth;</hi> that is, he hath a wandring heart, and is no wayes intent in the worſhip of God. <note place="margin">Prov. 4.25.</note> 
                     <hi>Let thine eyes look right on, and let thy eye-lids look ſtreight before thee.</hi> This is <hi>Solomons</hi> advice; the meaning is, that the thoughts of thy heart ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver turn aſide, neither to the right hand, nor unto the left; but this is the miſery of a godly man, that the fleſh makes him perform duty wandringly; as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> complaines, My hearr is gone from me, and I cannot catch it; and if I do eatch it, I cannot keep it. You know what a ſlippery thing an Eele is, the harder you graſpe it, the more apt it is to ſlip out of your hands; ſo it is with thy heart, thou mayeſt labour to hold thy heart faſt, but thy ſlippery heart breaks away from thee, do what thou canſt; and whence comes this, but by reaſon of the pravity of thy nature?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The fleſh makes thee perform duty confiding in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo to perform duty as to reſt in duty and if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil cannot diſturb you by injecting wandring thoughts, he will labour to diſturb you by caſting in vain tonfiding thoughts; this is an evill which you are to watch againſt. We are they (ſayes the Apoſtle, ſpeaking to the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>)
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115133:126"/>
                     <hi>who worſhip God in the ſpirit, and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.3.</note> that is, we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon our performances. Truſt not in lying words, ſayes the Prophet, ye who ſay, The Temple of the Lord, the <hi>Temple of the Lord;</hi> This was the devils policy, <note place="margin">Jer. 7.4.</note> if he could not make them ſlight the Temple, he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to carry them to the other extreame, to rely upon the Temple, and the worſhip there, and therefore the Lord calls them lying words. Thus it was with the children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 4.2.</note> The ſtory mentions a battel fought by the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> wherein there fell of <hi>Iſrael</hi> 4000 men, and when they had received this great loſſe, the reſidue went to inquire the reaſon of this hand of God againſt them, and they concluded that it was becauſe the Ark of God was not among them; well, ſay they, Let us fetch the Ark of the Covenant of God from <hi>Shiloh,</hi> that when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it may ſave us out of our enemies hands: they do ſo; but when they had got the ark among them, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 4.10.</note> the ſtory tells us, that in a ſecond battel, they <hi>loſt</hi> 30000. <hi>men.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 4.10.</note> Now what was the reaſon why they had worſe ſucceſſe when they had the Ark among them, then they had before; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, becauſe they depended upon the Ark, that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward badge and teſtimony of Gods preſence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God would puniſh their carnal confidence; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the policy of the devill, if he cannot diſtract you in duty, yet he will labour to make you rely upon it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the laſt Sermon I ſhewed you three wayes, by which the devill and your own hearts, laboured to diſtract and hinder you in duty. I proceed now to adde ſome more, and the fourth in order is this.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fleſh will labour to make you perform duties diſtruſtfully. Faith it is that ſhield by which we reſiſt the devil; <note place="margin">Eph. 6.16.</note> and the Scripture preſſeth us, <hi>Above all things to take to us the ſhield of faith, that we might be able to quench the fiery darts of the devill.</hi> Corrupt nature labours above all things to weaken your faith: <note place="margin">Luke 24.25.</note> 
                     <hi>O fooles, and ſlow of heart to believe!</hi> ſays our Saviour. Chriſt he layes the blame upon your hearts, this being the work of the fleſh to make you ſlow of heart to believe, and rely upon Jeſus Chriſt. <note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> 
                     <hi>He that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him;</hi> without faith you cannot perform ally acceptable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, and therefore alſo this is a main deſigne of the devill, to rob you of your faith. Chriſt he tells <hi>Peter,</hi> that Satan had deſired <hi>to winnow him as wheat;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke. 22.31,32.</note> but ſayes he, 
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115133:127"/>
                     <hi>I have prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not.</hi> Satan ſingled out <hi>Peters</hi> faith above all his other graces, and therefore the care of Chriſt was moſt ſeen in the preſervation of <hi>Peters</hi> faith from failing; and as this is the work of the devill, ſo alſo is it of our own hearts, to rob us of our faith; but Chriſt hath prayed for us, and true faith ſhall never faile.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another deſigne of the fleſh is, to make thee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form duty conſtrainedly, and not voluntarily; the fleſh puts a man into that poſture, that he is rather carried then led to duty; <note place="margin">Nil niſi juſſus agit.</note> he is driven to duty as a childe to School, or as a Bear to the ſtake, with much regret; whereas he goes from a duty, as a bird from the ſnare, with much delight.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The fleſh it will labour to make you perform duty uncomfortably, without delight of heart. And this is the great policy of the fleſh; though it cannot make you diſuſe duty, yet it will make you, that you ſhall never have delight in the uſe of them. Thus I have ſhewed what thoſe interruptions of the fleſh are, in regard of the manner of our duties.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The interruptions of the fleſh in duty, they are not onely ſeen in the manner how you do duty, but alſo in the end why you do duty. And herein I ſhall ſhew you how the fleſh caſts in ſiniſter aimes and ends, when you do duty; if it cannot interrupt you in the manner, it will in the end. I ſhall give a ſhort ſurvey how the fleſh interrupts men in doing duty, in reference to their ends. And there are ſeven ſiniſter ends that the fleſh caſts in when you are about duty.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The fleſh will caſt in this ſinfull end, to make you perform good duties rather for vain glory, then for Gods glory. It is obſervable, what you read in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. The Apoſtle concludes that Chapter with this exhortation, Be not deſirous of vain glory; after he had been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them what were the fruits of the Spirit, and had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to walk in the Spirit; he gives in this counſel,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115133:128"/>that they ſhould not be deſirous of vain glory, intimating that there is a proneneſſe in mans nature, to make him vain-glorious in the doing of good. Hence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>James</hi> hath an expreſſion; <note place="margin">Jam. 4.5.</note> ſayes he, <hi>Do ye think that the Scripture ſaith in vain, The ſpirit that dwelleth in us, luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to envy;</hi> envy it is a fruit of vain glory, a deſire to have another mans abilities eclipſed, that ſo our candle may ſhine brighter, <note place="margin">Phil. 1.15.</note> and hence ſome among the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> are ſaid to <hi>preach Christ out of envy;</hi> that is, they would diſcover their parts, to gain applauſe, that they might carry away the bell from <hi>Paul;</hi> it was their vain glory which made them ſeek to out-vie <hi>Paul:</hi> not that they aimed at Chriſts glory, but their own ſeeking, not the things of Chriſt, but their own things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another ſiniſter end of the fleſh will be this, to make you do duty, more for outward and ſecular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, then for any inward and ſaving benefit; and thus the Lord complaines of his people, <note place="margin">Hoſea 7.14.</note> 
                     <hi>That they aſſembled themſelves for corn and for wine;</hi> they did not cry for grace, but for <hi>corne and wine,</hi> their doing duty was for their ſecular advantage. And ſo the Lord by the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks concerning <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and ſayes he, <hi>Ephraim is a beifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corne: Ephraim</hi> loved duties, <note place="margin">Chap. 10. v. 11.</note> but ſuch, which would bring in profit and advantage. The fleſh in duty never looks for ſpiritual benefit, nor labours in duty and communion with Chriſt, to get mortification for corruption, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation of holy affections, with a furtherance in a way of grace, and holy experience.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The fleſh will put men upon duty, rather to pacify, then purify conſcience; juſt as a thief will give meat to a dog, but it is to ſtill the dogs barking, that thoſe which are in the houſe may not be awakened: Juſt thus will men do with their conſciences; they will perform duty, becauſe their conſciences are like barking dogs, checking and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, and therefore they will perform duty, that they may ſtill the noyſe of conſcience, <note place="margin">Jonah 1.5.</note> which otherwiſe will flie 
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115133:128"/>in their faces; as the mariners in <hi>Jonah</hi> prayed, but it was onely becauſe danger of death awakened their natural conciences.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fleſh will put men upon duty, rather out of a fear of the threatenings for neglect of duty, then out of love to the command which injoynes duty. The fleſh ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cares for the commands of God; all it feares, is the terrifying threatenings of Gods law. Were the Scripture all promiſes and precepts, a wicked man would be idle, and yet preſume; but becauſe there are threatenings mixt with theſe, therefore wicked men ſet upon duty, <note place="margin">Prov. 13.13. For nidine poenae.</note> and holy exerciſes. It is ſaid of a righteous man, that he <hi>feares the command,</hi> but a wicked man never feares the precept: he may fear the threatening and the puniſhment, but a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man dares not neglect duty, becauſe of the command of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fleſh will put upon the performance of duty, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the hope of the eternal reward of duty, <note place="margin">Mercedis amor, vel amor merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narius.</note> then out of any inward and ſpiritual excellency, that the ſoule ſees in them.

                  <p n="6">6. Corrupt nature will put men upon duty, to remove outward judgements, rather then inward judgements; judgements upon the body, rather then thoſe on the ſoule. Thus the Heathen mariners cried unto their gods when they were in a tempeſt, and like to loſe their lives, <note place="margin">Jonah 1.5.</note> that they might have the ſtorm abated, and get ſafe to land; every man falls to prayer: now this is but a ſervile, fleſhly end of duty, for a man to be put upon it rather to avoid bodily, then ſoul-judgements; and thus it was with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> when the Lord ſlew their firſt-born, then it is ſaid, <note place="margin">Exod. 12.32,33.</note> that <hi>Pharaoh and the Egyptians cried unto the Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, Riſe up and be gone, you and your flocks and your heards, and go and ſerve the Lord your God; and they were urgent with them, for they ſaid, We are all dead men. Pharaoh</hi> would not let them go before; but when their going out would conduce to their ſafety, then he bids them be gone; this
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115133:129"/>is the nature of all men, naturally to ſet on duty rather to avoid bodily afflictions, then inward judgements. To this purpoſe the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaks, <note place="margin">Jer. 22.23.</note>

                  <p n="2">2. Thou art without ſtrength to have any good motion; not onely to have good actions, but good thoughts; and this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts, but good thoughts; and <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.5.</note>

                  <p>I anſwer, that good works may be conſidered two wayes, either <hi>formally,</hi> or <hi>materially;</hi> now indeed a 
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115133:130"/>wicked man, he may do that which is materially good; and ſo hearing, and praying, and giving of almes, the matter of theſe duties is good; he may do external good duties: but to do good formally, with all thoſe requiſites, and concurrent circumſtances required in a good work, ſo no wicked man in this world is able to do good.</p>
                  <p>There are many concurring circumſtances to a good action.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The perſon muſt be in Chriſt, which doth the action.</hi> The ſame action which a wicked man doing ſhall go to hell for, the ſame action a godly man performing, in the doing thereof, ſhall go to heaven; ſo that the perſon muſt be intereſſed in Chriſt who doth good: we muſt acknowledge every good thing which is in us in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> For anſwer, I confeſſe that this is an objection very ſuitable to fleſh and blood; <note place="margin">Job 9.29.</note> and <hi>Job</hi> he makes it in the perſon of a wicked man: <hi>If I be wicked</hi> (ſayes he,) <hi>why then labour I in vain?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, if when I pray, and when I hear, I ſin, then why do I labour in vain? this was an objection boyling in <hi>Job</hi>'s breſt.—But to anſwer the Queſtion:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though a wicked man <hi>doth ſin in duty,</hi> yet <hi>he muſt do duty;</hi> he is bound to duty, though not to ſinne in that dury; that which is good in it ſelfe, is not to be forborn, though an accidental evil follow; It is good in it ſelfe, that a man ſhould hear, and pray, and do other duties, but it is onely caſual that a man ſins in theſe; if this ſhould be admitted, by the ſame reaſon the Sunne ſhould not ſhine,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115133:130"/>becauſe it over-heats ſome bodies, and puts them into a fever, or becauſe it parches and over-dries the ground.</p>

This is the <hi>Pelagian</hi> objection: Doth not God mock men, ſay they, God bids wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men to pray and repent, but they are no more able to do theſe duties acceptably, then to move the world?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer hereunto; that though the wicked are thus unable, yet there is great reaſon, why God ſhould command.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To let them ſee what once they were, in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency they being perfectly able to do the will of God.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Though God commands men what they are not able to performe; yet to all elect men, though unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, God ſometime or other, will ſend forth his owne power with his own command, and make it efficacious in their ſoules; Thus there went a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with Gods command to dead <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whereby he came out of the grave; <note place="margin">Verbum Dei non eſt decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rativum modò, ſed effectivum.</note> God who commands a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man to repent, can convey a power into his heart, to make him repent; therefore there is great reaſon, and uſe of Gods commands, though natural men are not able to obey them.</p>

If the fleſh doth interrupt in duty, then what great need have you, when you are about duty, to watch over your hearts, and to fortify them againſt the incurſions and diſturbances of the fleſh. Thoſe that live by the Sea-ſide, they are forced for the preſervation of themſelves in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to make great mounts and banks to keep out the Sea from overflowing them; whereas thoſe who dwell in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-countreys, little ditches will ſerve their turns: Corrupt nature it is a Sea, and thou haſt need to make many a mount, and many a bank in thy heart, otherwiſe corrupt nature will ſend in an inundation of vain and impertinent thoughts. <note place="margin">Numb. 4 23.</note> It is a good note of <hi>Ainſworth</hi> upon <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.23. where all from thirty yeares old to fifty of the houſe of <hi>Gerſhon,</hi> are ſaid to enter in to perform ſervice, and to do the work of the Tabernacle. The word which ſignifies to perform ſervice, ſignifies alſo to warre a warfare, and ſo <hi>Ainſworth</hi> tranſlates it; and why doth the Scripture mention this, but to note that when you are doiug any ſervice to God, <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.7.</note> you are then to warre a ſpiritual warfare.

                     <note place="margin">Col. 4.2.</note> 4.2. <hi>Of watching in prayer.</hi> You are not only to watch unto, before you pray, but in prayer, whileſt you pray, You have not only ground to watch againſt the interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of the fleſh, but there are alſo other interruptions; As firſt from the world; and this is the Apoſtles deſire, that

                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.35.</note> and that we might attend upon the Lord without diſtraction. Cares of the world they are a hinderance unto holy duties, and therefore we are to watch againſt them. Secondly, we are hindred alſo by natural infirmities, and thoſe we are to watch ugainſt; and ſo I underſtand <hi>Piſcator</hi> upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.41. <note place="margin">Mat. 26.41.</note> where Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>that the ſpirit was willing, but the fleſh was weak.</hi> Fleſh there is not to be taken for corrupt nature, but for bodily infirmity. And then not onely from the world and natural indiſpoſitions, but; Thirdly, from the devil are interruptions, and hinderances caſt in; and in this caſe you are to do as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, when the fowles did light upon his ſacrifice, he drove them away. <note place="margin">Gen. 15.11.</note> By the fowles coming upon the carcaſes of <hi>Abrahams</hi> offering, as <hi>Deodate</hi> ſaith, it is an evident ſigne of the devils diſturbing the elect, when they are about any holy performance; now as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, ſo do you; when theſe fowles as they are compared in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.4 to the devil, thoſe foul and infernal ſpirits, when they come to diſturb you in worſhip, you muſt drive them away; all thoſe impertinencies, and vain thoughts, which the devil caſts in. <note place="margin">Job 1.6.</note> In the firſt of <hi>Job</hi> you read, that upon a certain day, <hi>the Sons of God preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves before the Lord,</hi> and Satan alſo came among them; By the Sonnes of God there cannot be meant the Angels; for then it would follow that the devils would be in heaven where the Angels are; therefore by the Sonnes of God are meant the children of <hi>Iob;</hi> and thus were the poſterity of <hi>Seth</hi> called in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. <note place="margin">Gen. 6.2.

And therefore ſeeing that you have not onely your own hearts, the world, and natural infirmities; but the devil
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:115133:134"/>alſo to hinder and divert you, what cauſe have you with utmoſt diligence to watch over your ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If the fleſh doth interrupt you in Gods ſervice, then learn not to place any confidence in your moſt religious performances; dareſt thou lay the weight of thy ſoul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a weak foundation? if thy duties are tainted, and mingled with ſo much evill, how dareſt thou reſt in thy duties? It is the ſpeech of <hi>Iob, Though I were righteous, yet would I not plead with thee;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job 9.28.</note> and again ſayes he, <hi>I am afraid of all my ſorrowes, I know that thou wilt hold me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</hi> In the vulgar tranſlation it is, I am afraid of all my good works; and further ſayes he, <hi>Though I ſhould waſh my ſelfe with ſnow-water, and make my ſelfe never ſo clean, yet ſhalt thou plunge me in a ditch, and my own clothes ſhall abhorre me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cap. 30.31.</note> Though I ſhould acquit my ſelfe never ſo well in duty, yet thou wouldeſt finde much evil in me. If then thy beſt ſervices are mingled with ſin, rely on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon a Chriſt for ſalvation; and here to ſet home this inference, I ſhall lay down three cogent conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thou haſt more acts of ſin that come from the fleſh, then acts of grace that come from the Siprit in thy duties; and wilt thou reſt upon ſuch a duty that hath more ſinne then grace acted in it? more wandring thoughts then holy thoughts? thou forgetteſt more of a Sermon, then thou remembreſt of a Sermon, and the ſin of thy nature doth caſt in more wandring thoughts, then the Spirit of God doth caſt in holy thoughts; thy graces are as the filings of gold, but thy ſinnes as heapes of duſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how dareſt thou reſt on thy duties, expecting life and ſalvation by them?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider that one circumſtance in a duty, is enough to make it evil; but many concurring circumſtances is not enough to make a duty good. Suppoſe thou prayeſt, one circumſtance in thy prayer may make it ſinful: though thou prayeſt wel for the manner, yet if thou art defective in the end; or if the end be right, yet if thou faileſt in thy 
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:115133:134"/>principle, it is not right. It is a rule in moral Philoſophy, <note place="margin">In moralibus plus circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti a quàm ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia actio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>is</note> that circumſtances are more to be weighed then acts; and ſo it is in Divinity. One circumſtance may make a duty defective, but many circumſtances concurring together, cannot make a duty good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider, that thou art guilty of many paſt ſins, and preſent duties cannot make a recompence for paſt ſinnes. Suppoſe a tenant who payes his rent duly for time preſent, yet being in arrear, it may be ten or twenty yeares, his payment of his rent at preſent will not recompenſe his paſt arrear: Thus it is with thee, thou art much in debt, and in arreare to God for paſt time, and if there were merit in thy duties, as there is not, yet preſent duty could not expiate paſt ſinnes; therefore rely not upon duty.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Doth the fleſh thus interrupt us in duty? then from hence we may ſee the evill nature of ſin, the miſchievous quality of original corruption. It is a doctrine which cau never be too much inſiſted upon, and therefore from this doctrine I beſeech you turn a little to ſee the evil nature of originall ſin. I may illuſtrate it by this example: if you have a veſſel full of liquor, a little gall ſhall more imbitter it, then a great deal of honey ſhall ſweeten it; behold, the miſchievous nature of ſinee, how doth it taint both thy perſon and performances? You read of a Law in <hi>Numb.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Numb 19.22.</note> 19 22. that whatſoever an unclean perſon toucheth, ſhall be uuclean: this is ſpoken of ceremonial uncleanneſſe; but it holds true alſo in ſpirituals: thou art an unclean man, all thou toucheſt becomes unclean; thou defileſt all thy duties. There is an uſeful paſſage in <hi>Haggai</hi> 2.12,13. <note place="margin">Hag. 2.12,13.</note> there was an caſe of conſcience which the people were to demand of the Prieſts concerning the Law. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was this, <hi>If one beat holy fleſh in the skirt of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and with his skirts do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oile, or any meat, ſhall it be holy?</hi> and the Prieſts ſaid, No. And then ſaid <hi>Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy touch any of theſe, ſhall it be unclean? and the Prieſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115133:135"/>and ſaid, It ſhall be unclean.</hi> Here you may obſerve that holy things could not make common things clean and holy; but if a man that was unclean did but touch holy things, they became unclean. Now if you would know the meaning of this, it is explained by the Prophet in the 14. verſe. <hi>Then anſwered</hi> Haggai <hi>and ſaid, So is this people, and ſo is this Nation before me, ſaith the Lord, and ſo is every worke of their hands, and that which they offer there, is unclean;</hi> that is every ſacrifice, and every duty is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean. In Goſpel-language the meaning is this, if a man be in the ſtate of nature, all his offerings, and all his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, <note place="margin">Tit. 1.15.</note> that is, all his duties, they are unclean unto him: <hi>For unto the unclean, all things are unclean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> The ſecond Uſe I ſhall make of this point, ſhall be by way of comfort; and there are eight conſolations I ſhall give in to thoſe that fear God, and are ſenſible of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of the fleſh in duty of Gods worſhip.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Know to your comfort, that as you have the fleſh to hinder, ſo you have the Spirit to help you in duty. <hi>The Spirit will help thy infirmities, with ſighes and groans, which cannot be untered;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom 8.26.</note> thou haſt the fleſh to harden thy heart, and deaden thy ſpirit; but thou haſt the Spirit of God alſo to ſoften thy heart, and quicken thy ſpirit; to make thee pray with ſighes, <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.4.</note> and groans. And though the devil be buſie to tempt thee, yet <hi>Stronger is he that is in you,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John, then he that is in the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider, that a deſire to do thoſe duties you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, is in divine account a doing of them. It is worth your noting what you finde recorded touching <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> if you compare two Scripturts together:—The firſt is <hi>Nehem.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Neh. 1.11.</note> 1.11. where he prayes, <hi>Lord, let thy eare be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive unto the prayer of thy ſervant, who deſires to fear thy Name.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Compared with</hi> Neh. 5.15.</note> And <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5.15. ſaith <hi>Nehemiah, I did not oppreſſe the people as former Governours did, becauſe of the fear of the Lord.</hi> So that <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> deſire to fear the Lord, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by God, the fear of God; a deſire after any grace, is in divine account the having of that grace. The Lord
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115133:135"/>he will accept the will for the deed <hi>If there be a willing minde, it is accepted according to what a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.12. <hi>See</hi> Mat. 5.5. Joh. 7.37. Pſal. 10.17. Pſal. 145.19. Exod. 14.15. 1 King. 8.17,18.</note> Therefore ſee what a good God you ſerve, who will accept of purpoſes for performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and intentions for executions, as may appeare by many teſtimonies of Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Feeling the want of any grace, or ability to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge any duty, and being grieved for that want, is in the account of God, as if that want were ſupplied. Thou ſayeſt thou canſt not mourne, but wouldſt thou mourne for thy ſinnes? why, a ſenſe of the want of any grace, is in divine acceptance, the having of it; and this ſome make to be the meaning of that place in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <note place="margin">Rom. 8.26.</note> 
                     <hi>We know not what to pray for, as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelfe maketh interceſſion for us with ſighes and groans;</hi> that is, the Spirit helps us to grieve that we cannot pray, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, nor do duty no better; and herein is the <hi>aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit ſeen.</hi> And this God will accept.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Remember this, that God accepts of ſincerity of heart, where there is not perfection of grace. You live under a Covenant of grace, wherein God accepts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity inſtead of perfection, and God had rather ſee truth of grace, then ſtrength of parts. Thou complaineſt thou canſt not pray, it may be thou wanteſt the gift of prayer; thou haſt not a voluble tongue, but thou doeſt not want truth of deſire, neither the ornament of a meek ſpirit, a pure heart. God had rather have truth of grace, then ſtrength of parts; you may conſider it in the caſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.4. <hi>I know, ſaith God to</hi> Moſes, <note place="margin">Exod. 4.4.</note> 
                     <hi>that</hi> Aaron <hi>thy brother can ſpeak well.</hi> Now <hi>Moſes</hi> he was a man of a ſtammering tongue; but yet when <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aron</hi> was to be imployed in that great work of prayer, when <hi>Joſhua</hi> fought againſt <hi>Amaleck.</hi> God makes choice not of elegant <hi>Aaron,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 17.11.12.</note> but of ſtammering <hi>Moſes</hi> to make the prayer. <hi>Moſes</hi> could pray better then <hi>Aaron,</hi> though <hi>Aaron</hi> had better parts.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Conſider, it may be thou complaineſt that it is the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:115133:136"/>interruption of the fleſh, which hinders thee in duty, when only it is the diſability of thy natural body. Thus godly men do many times charge their unfitneſſe to duty upon their own hearts, when it is only from an indiſpoſed, and diſabled body. You muſt know that ſometimes the body doth diſable a man to do duty, and that diſability is not ſinful; it is thy miſery, but not thy ſinne. Thus it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gal 4.13,14.</note> he ſpeakes thus to the <hi>Galatians, Ye know how through infirmity of the fleſh I preached the Goſpel to you at the first; and my temptation which was in my fleſh, ye deſpiſed not, nor rejected, but received me as an Angel of God, even as Chriſt Jeſus. Jerome</hi> underſtands theſe words of a bodily weakneſſe, diſabling <hi>Paul</hi> to preach, and yet it is ſaid the <hi>Galatians</hi> bore with him, and rejected him not under this bodily infirmity. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians, that he would have come unto them once and again, but Satan hindred him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2.18.</note> Some think this hindrance was perſecution, others that it was a tempeſt at Sea, but moſt think that it was ſome bodily diſeaſe whereby the devil hindred him. So that if thou haſt a ſick, pained, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed body, and thereby art diſabled to duty, this though it be thy miſery, yet it is not thy ſinne; and therefore in ſuch a caſe do not lay the blame upon thy own heart: <note place="margin">Mat. 26.41.</note> for it is with a man in this caſe, as with a ſtrong healthful man that rides upon a poore tired horſe:—thus the ſoul though active, and vigorous, is ſometimes forced to keep pace with a weak, ſick, and tired body.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Remember this, that God accepts what is his own in duty, and covers what is thine. That water which is ſalt in the Sea, is freſh in the river; that duty which comes from thee, is ſalt and brackiſh, but coming through the river of Chriſts blood, it loſeth its unſavoury taſte; and what a great indulgence is this in God, to, cover what is ours, and to accept what is his own? It is a rule in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, <note place="margin">Denominatio ſequitar majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent partem.</note> that the denomination is alwayes taken from the greater part; God denominates a man from his better part; be ſinnes in prayer, and he acts grace in prayer;
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115133:136"/>that as wine, though it be mingled with water, and that mixture doth in part debaſe the wine, yet becauſe the wine gives a reliſh, and ſtill retaines the colour of wine, therefore the whole cup is called wine: So though in thy heart there may be a mixture of ſinne with thy grace in thy duty, yet the whole ſhall be called graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous act.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Though the fleſh hinders you in the doing of duty, yet there is a vaſt difference between a godly and a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man in this very caſe, though the interruption be both in the one and the other;—as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The wicked they are interrupted by the fleſh, but they have not the Spirit to aſſiſt them againſt corruption, as the godly have.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The wicked have not renewed principles of grace in their hearts to withſtand the corruptions of the fleſh, as the godly have. Regenerate men they cannot ſinne, (that is, <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.9.</note> ſo ſinne as the wicked) becauſe they have a ſeed of grace remaining in them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wicked men they do not ſo clearly diſcerne, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly bewaile the interruptions of the fleſh, as thoſe who are godly do.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The wicked they ſhall never be rid of the evil workings of the fleſh, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come. Sinne in this life ſhall hinder duty; and in the world to come they will caſt off duty. But the godly though peſtered with the fleſh, yet they ſhall one day be rid of the fleſh. And thus I have finiſhed the firſt part of the double conſequent.</p>

                     <note place="margin">verſe 10. verſ. 12.</note> and in the twelfth verſe, <hi>If they obey not, they ſhall periſh by the ſword, and ſhall die without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> The ſinne of nature, it is deſcribed by a ſtate of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; to note that a man without the Spirit, is blinde, and cannot ſee thoſe evils which he commits; the Spirit therefore enlightens a man, and hence you read, <note place="margin">Acts 26.18.</note> that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent <hi>to open mens eyes, and to turn them from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> 2 King 6.15.</note> intimating that there muſt be firſt the opening of the eyes, and the enlightening of the judgement, before there can be a reſcuing from ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Spirit keeps a man from ſinne by ſetting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience on work to check and rebuke a man, when he is tempted thereunto. Conſcience is Gods Officer, and mans Overſeer; and were it not for a natural conſcience, a wicked man would commit all imaginable evills, every wicked man would commit every ſinne that he had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to act. Now as ſinne wounds the conſcience after commiſſion, ſo conſcience checks for ſinne before commiſſion. It is conſcience which is as an iron gate, and as a brazen wall to keep thee from many evills which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe thou wouldſt run into. And therefore <hi>Ioſeph</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults with his conſcience, <hi>How can I do this great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe?</hi> and this kept him from committing folly with his Miſtreſſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another way whereby the Spirit keeps a man from ſinne, is by infuſing into a man a principle of grace and holineſſe, repugnant to that principle of ſinne, which is in the nature; and thus the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> tells you, that <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever

                        </gap> born of God, doth not commit ſinne: for the ſeed of God remaineth in him; and he cannot ſinne, becauſe he is born of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.9.</note>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.18.</note> He that is born of God hath a renewed nature, and a new principle put into him, contrary to the ſin of his nature.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Spirit keeps a man from evil, by calling to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance ſome particular paſſage out of Sctipture, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that ſinne unto which he is tempted. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes, that he had hid the Word of the Lord in his heart, <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.11.</note> that he might not ſinne againſt him. This is the way whereby the Spirit fortifies the heart againſt ſin; you have it often mentioned in particular caſes. <hi>Solomon</hi> gives this counſel to his ſonne, that he ſhould keep his words, <note place="margin">Prov. 7.1,5.</note> 
                     <hi>and lay up his commandments; and that to this end, that they may keep thee from the ſtrange woman;</hi> and thus <hi>David,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 17.4.</note> ſaies he, <hi>By the Word of thy lips, I have kept me from the paths of the deſtroyer.</hi> Thus <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reports of a young man who was given to wantonneſſe, and it pleaſed God by bringing this paſſage to his remembrance, <hi>Not in rioting, and drunkenneſſe, not in chambring, and wantonneſſe;</hi> it pleaſed God to make this a meanes whereby he left off his dalliance, and wantonneſſe ever after.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Spirit keeps a man from doing the evil he would, by poſſeſſing the heart with an awe and dread of the preſence of God, when he is tempted to evil: <hi>Fear the Lord, and depart from evil;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 37.</note> the wiſe man joynes them both together, to let you know, that when the heart is poſſeſſed with the fear of God, it keeps a man from evil. And thus <hi>Solomon</hi> in a parallell place ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe, <note place="margin">Prov. 16.6. Prov. 14.16.</note> that <hi>By the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.</hi> An awefull fear of the great God, is a good preſervative gainſt ſin.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. In regard of the kindes of ſinne, ſo the Spirit keeps a regenerate man, that he ſhall never commit the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt; not but that there is the ſeed of that ſinne in the godly, as well as others, this you have fully proved by <hi>John,</hi> in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.18. <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.18.</note> After he had been telling that there was a ſinne unto death, and ſaies he, I do not ſay, ye ſhall pray for it; he tells you after in the eighteenth verſe, <hi>We know</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>that whoſoever is born of God, ſinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himſelfe, and that wicked one toucheth him not;</hi> That is, ſhall not prevaile over a godly man to ſinne this ſinne unto death; grace in the hearr will keep a man, that the wicked one ſhall not ſo touch him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Spirit of God will keep a man that he ſhall not commit ſinne, at that time, and in that place where he would. Thus the Spirit kept <hi>David;</hi> in a pettiſh mood he reſolves to kill <hi>Nabal,</hi> and all his family: but <hi>Abigail</hi> coming to meet <hi>David,</hi> by good perſwaſions ſoon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed <hi>Davids</hi> hot ſpirit; and herein the work of Gods Spirit was exceedingly ſeen, that though <hi>David</hi> reſolved that at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a place he would do thus and thus, yet the overruling hand of Gods Spirit kept him back.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And chiefly the Spirit keeps a man from ſinne in reſpect of the manner, how a man doth evil. A regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man, he ſhall not ſinne after that manner as he did ſinne before he was converted. I ſhewed you before how the Spirit keeps a man from fulfilling ſinne: And now I ſhall ſhew you how the Spirit of God keeps a regenerate man from ſinning after that manner as formerly he did. And there are ſeven particulars, which I ſhall mention in this Point.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:115133:139"/>1. A regenerate man he ſhall not ſinne ſo ignorantly as formerly he hath done. <hi>Paul</hi> tells you of himſelfe, that during his unconverted ſtate, the Lord had mercy on him, <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.13.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe he ſinned of ignorance;</hi> but when a man is once converted, his eyes are then opened, and he ſhall not ſinne ſo ignorantly. <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.14.</note> Hereunto referres that exhortation of the Apoſtle, <hi>As obedient children, not faſhioning your ſelves according to the former luſts in your ignorance:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore converſion a man walks in darkneſſe; and as the wiſe man ſpeaks, <note place="margin">Prov. 4.19. Joh. 12.35.</note> 
                     <hi>he knows not at what he ſtumbles.</hi> An unconverted age is a dark age, a man ſins, and he knows it not; but after converſion God puts a light into the ſoul, whereby he ſhall be able to ſee into the miſchievous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou canſt not commit ſin ſo ſtupidly, and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly as formerly. Before converſion ſin did no more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy conſcience, then gravel in the fingers of thy glove; but now it is as gravel grating in thy bowels; before thou waft ſtupid, and as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, thou hadſt thy conſcience <hi>ſeared as with a hot iron:</hi>

                        </gap>.</note> but now a godly man ſets it before his eyes; before thou waft paſt feeling, now ſin is as a dagger at thy heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thou canſt not ſin ſo contentedly as in former time: heretofore thou wallowedſt in ſin, as a Sow in the mire, but now thou art as a Sheep in the mire, which would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aine be in the green medows again. I told you formerly, <note place="margin">Jude 18.</note> that corruption in a godly man, it was like poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in a mans body, troubleſome and painful; but ſinne in the wicked; it was but like poyſon in a toade, which was natural; before thy converſion thou waſt as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with ſin and corruption in thee, as a toade that hath poyſon naturally in it: but now after converſion, ſinne
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:115133:139"/>troubles thee as if poyſon were in thy bowels; <note place="margin">Prov. 13.23 2 Theſ. 2.12.</note> ſinne to a wicked man is his ſport and paſtime, to the godly his grief and burden.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thou doeſt not ſo fearleſly commit ſinne, as in times paſt. Formerly thou <hi>didſt ruſh into ſinne, as a horſe ruſheth into the battel,</hi> thou hadſt not the impreſſion of Gods fear ſtamped upon thy minde, the dread of God did not keep thee from ſin; but when God hath converted a man, he ſinnes with more feare of heart then ever he did before; and it is worthy your noting, that when the Scripture ſpeakes of a converted man, it doth not ſpeak of him, as forbearing a ſinne, but fearing of it. A good man is one, who not only forbeareth idle ſwearing, <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.2. Prov. 13.13</note> but <hi>feareth an oath.</hi> And hence godly men are ſaid to <hi>fear the command.</hi> A wicked man may fear the threatening, and the puniſhment, but it is only a good man which <hi>fears the command;</hi> and therefore will not ſin, becauſe it is againſt a holy law.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The Spirit will keep thee, that thou ſhalt not ſinne ſo maliciouſly as thou haſt done formerly. Before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion the Scripture ſpeakes of wicked men, <note place="margin">Judg 15.</note> that the Lord ſhall convince them of their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodlily committed. The Scripture ſpeaks not only of ungodly men, and ungodly deeds, but of committing ungodly deeds, ungodlily; that is, after a moſt ungodly manner, after a moſt wilful, and malicious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: But ſo thou canſt not commit ſinne after converſion. We reade of ſome who do <hi>deſpite unto the Spirit of grace,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 10.29.</note> but a godly man ſhall never ſo ſinne; he may quench the Spirits motions, and he may grieve the Spirit; but he ſhall never do deſpite unto the Spirit. A godly man ſhall never ſinne out of malicious wickedneſſe. <note place="margin">Pſal. 59.5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Thou canſt not do evil, as to the maine, not ſo volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily as thou haſt formerly done; before converſion thou didſt ruſh into ſinne voluntarily, but now thou goeſt and yieldeſt to ſinne, with much unwillingneſſe. This change doth converting grace make in thee; formerly
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115133:140"/>thou didſt ſinne with all thy will, but now there is one part of the will againſt the other, and therefore ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>With my minde I ſerve the law of God, but with my fleſh the law of ſinne;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.25.</note> whereas before converſion, the whole of man was given up to the ſervice of ſinne: a childe of God when he is converted, though he ſinne: yet it is upon ſome ſurpriſe, as <hi>Peter</hi> raſhly denied Chriſt; but a wicked man ſinnes deliberately, even as <hi>Judas</hi> betrayed Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Not ſo impudently as before converſion; then men ſinned and were not aſhamed, as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeakes, but now with fear and bluſhing ſhame.</p>
                  <p>The next Queſtion is, ſeeing this is a bleſſing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to wicked men as well as to the godly, to be kept from evil; then what difference is there between the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining grace of the Spirit in wicked men, <note place="margin">Jer. 6.15.</note> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing grace of the Spirit in the godly?—But this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion I ſhall not now handle, but ſhall reſerve it for the next Sermon.—That which I ſhall now do, ſhall be to conclude this Sermon, with ſome uſe of what you have heard.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The great miſery of thoſe men who are deſtitute of the Spirit to do this great <hi>and good office for them;</hi> what ſlaves to ſinne are they who are void of the Spirit, they are liable to every incurſion, and invaſion which the devil ſhall make upon them. Now the Spirits motions and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, they are as a bulwark and fence to guard the heart againſt ſinne. The Spirit it is as the ſluce of a pond, if the flood-gate be down, it keeps the water within its bounds; but if you pull up the ſluce, what an inundation of water will there be?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If thou wouldſt have the Spirit to keep thee from evil, thou muſt labour to keep thy ſelfe; the Spirits keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a man doth not exclude his holy care to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: <note place="margin">Pſal. 18.23.</note> this was <hi>Davids</hi> practice, <hi>He kept himſelfe from his

Remember and take this for a rule, that if you do not take care to keep your ſelves from the occaſions of ſinne, the Spirit will never keep you from the execution thereof; and therefore you reade, <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.18.</note> that <hi>he that is begotten of God, he keepeth himſelfe, that the evil one toucheth him not;</hi> and ſo ſpeaks <hi>Jude, Keep your ſelves in the love of God.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. What cauſe have regenerate men to bleſſe God, both in reference to themſelves, and in reference to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reference to themſelves; to what evil would not the fleſh have drawn you, had it not been for the contrary working of the Spirit in you? I appeale to your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, how often have you reſolved to do wickedly, nay, how farre have you gone in it? inſomuch that you have reſolved on the time when, on the place where, and the manner how to bring your intended evil about, and yet God hath kept you from your intended purpoſe, ſo that ye could not do the evil ye would; what cauſe have you to bleſſe God for poſitive grace, and not only ſo, but for <hi>preventing grace,</hi> that you have been reſtrained from ſin? It was thus with <hi>David,</hi> with a full reſolution, he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to kill <hi>Nabal,</hi> and all his family; but the Spirit of God prevented it, by ſetting home the counſell of a poor woman; and therefore here upon ſee what cauſe you have to bleſſe God for preventing grace; and that you may be provoked hereunto, I would leave with you ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations upon a twofold account.

                  <p n="4">4. There is an univerſality in reſpect of the time; this corruption of nature, it was not only in one age of the world, and not in another; but in all ages of the world. It reigned from Adam <hi>to</hi> Moſes, <note place="margin">Rom. 5.14.</note> 
                     <hi>even over thoſe who had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of</hi> Adams <hi>tranſgreſſion.</hi> Now put all theſe together, that all perſons, and all parts of men are corrupted, and that in all times, and that this corruption prompts you to all ſinne, conſider but all this, and have you not great cauſe to admire, that there is no more wickedneſſe committed in the world?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider not only the univerſality of corruption, but the ſtrength of it. If it were but a weak enemy, it were not ſo much, but there is great ſtrength and potency in it, and therefore it is called ſometimes an enticing, and ſometimes a drawing enemy; and if it cannot entice by policy, it will draw by power.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are to magnifie Gods grace in reference to wicked men, that are enemies to the Church of God; if the reſtraining grace of Gods Spirit did not withhold wicked men from doing the evil they would, there would be no living in the world; if it were not thus, every wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man would murther every man that angred him, and he would deceive every man that dealed with him; we ſhould have all humane ſocieties overturned, the Church of

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Come now to handle the third Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is this, wherein doth the difference appear between the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining grace of the Spirit, in keeping wicked men from ſinne, and between the renewing grace of the Spirit, which is in the godly?</p>
                  <p>For anſwer to this queſtion Iſhall lay down ſeven differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing marks.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The reſtraining grace of the Spirit in wicked men, <note place="margin">Num. 23.13.</note> it doth only ſuppreſſe and abate the acts, but doth not alter the diſpoſition, and will of a man as to ſiune. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraning grace to a wicked man it is juſt as a chaine to a Lion, or a priſon to a thief, which reſtraines the rage of the one, and thy theft of the other, but changes not at all the nature of either. You have two Scripture-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances for the confirmation hereof. The one is of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who told <hi>Balack, That if he would give him his houſe full of ſilver and gold, he could not curſe the people.</hi> But this forbearance to curſe them, did not ariſe from any indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that he had thereunto, <note place="margin">Num. 23.1. &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>4. &amp; ver. 27.</note> but only from Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. The Scripture gives you a fourfold attempt of 
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115133:142"/>his to curſe them; and in <hi>Num.</hi> 24.1. <note place="margin">Num. 24.1.</note> you have there a high expreſſion; when <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaw that it pleaſed the Lord to bleſſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he went not as at other times to ſeek for inchantments, but he ſet his face towards the wilderneſſe. The meaning is this, <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Arthur Jackſon.</hi> his Annotations on Num. 24.1</note> as a learned Expoſitor obſerves, that <hi>Balaam</hi> went three times to have the devil to curſe the people, but firſt he would aske Gods leave whether he ſhould curſe them or no. But now the text ſaith, <hi>he did not aske God leave,</hi> but did look toward the wilderneſſe, that is, toward the place where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were incamped; and ſo he attempted to curſe the people without Gods leave, and therefore he ſet his face toward the people to ſee if he were able to do it; and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that though he did not curſe the people, yet he <hi>loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.15. Eſt. 5.9,10.</note> So we read of <hi>Haman,</hi> it is ſaid, when he ſaw <hi>Mordecai</hi> preferred, that he was moved with indignation againſt him; but yet the text ſaith, that <hi>Haman</hi> refrained himſelf; not that <hi>Hamans</hi> paſſion was ſubdued, or altered againſt <hi>Mordecai;</hi> but meerly God reſtrained and kept in his rage. Reſtraining grace to a wicked man may be illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by theſe two example: of the fiery furnace wherein the three children were caſt, and the den of Lions into which <hi>Daniel</hi> was thrown. The fiery furnace it was as hot as ever, and ſeventimes hotter then it formerly had been; but at that time while the three children were in, God did ſuſpend, or reſtraine the natural property of the fire to burne: Thus it is with wicked men, their luſts do burne as hot in them as ever; only God by a mighty power, keeps under their luſts. <note place="margin">Dan. 6.22.</note> The Lions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom <hi>Daniel</hi> was thrown, they kept their rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous diſpoſition while <hi>Daniel</hi> was in the denne, but God reſtrained it all the while <hi>Daniel</hi> was there: thus God deals with wicked men; he may reſtraine their ſin, but their diſpoſition is toward ſin ſtill.—But now it is contrary with renuing grace; it reaches not only to the ſuppreſſing of the act, but works an alteration in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition 
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:115133:143"/>of a man; it doth not onely reſtraine a Lion, but turnes a Lion into a Lamb; <note place="margin">Rom. 12.2.</note> there is in the work of regeneration, <hi>A renuing of the minde,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks; there is a change in the minde that was not there before, and therefore ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>If ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.</note> not only reſtraine the act, but mortifie the diſpoſition; this is the effect of renuing grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Reſtraining grace makes a natural man refrain from ſin more becauſe of the ſeverity of the law which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes, then becauſe of the purity of the law which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids ſin. And this is it which <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of; ſayes he, That man which feares hell, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Impii metuunt ardere, non me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuunt peccare: ille autem pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care metuit, qui peccatum iplum ſicut</hi> Gehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam <hi>odit.</hi> Aug. Epiſt. 144. Pſ. 119.140.</note> he doth not fear to ſinne, but fears to burne; but that man fears to ſinne, that feares ſinne as he would fear hell. Reſtraining grace never makes a man thus fear ſin; but renuing grace doth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Becauſe, ſayes he, <hi>thy Word is very pure, therefore thy ſervant loveth it.</hi> It is not only a threatening Word againſt ſin, but a pure Word, which <hi>forbids ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Reſtraining grace it doth only make a man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear groſſe and palpable ſins; but doth not reach to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abſtinence from ſecret and inward evils. Outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint doth not reach to inward ſinnes. Natural conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may ſee ſinnes that are more groſſe; that as we have a ſight of the ſtars, in a bright night we may ſee the ſmalleſt ſtarres, but in a dark night we can only ſee thoſe that are of a greater magnitude: Thus it is with reſtraint which comes from natural conſcience, it only keeps in thoſe ſinnes which are of a more groſſe nature; whereas we are to mortifie our ſinful and inordinate affections; and thus the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> commands, <note place="margin">Col. 3.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Mortifie</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>your members that are upon the earth, fornication, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clcanneſſe, inordinate affection, evil concupiſcence, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, which is idolatry.</hi> Here you ſee that not only the act, but the diſpoſition; and not only irregular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but inordinate affections are forbidden; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:115133:143"/>it was that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> he humbled himſelfe for the pride of his heart; <note place="margin">2 Chron. 32.25 2 Sam. 24.10.</note> and <hi>David</hi> alſo for the pride of his heart in numbering the people.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Reſtrained corruption it is unwillingly left; a man doth unwillingly leave that ſinne he is kept from; and this is hinted to us by that expreſſion concerning <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.6. where the Lord ſaid, <note place="margin">Gen. 20.6.</note> 
                     <hi>I alſo withheld thee from ſinning againſt me;</hi> the word notes a forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe on <hi>Abimelech</hi> his part to commit fornication with <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife. Reſtraining grace makes a man leave his ſinnes as unwillingly as a man that leaves his wife and children, countrey and eſtate; he leaves theſe with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, and bids them farewell with tears in his eyes, and ſorrow in his heart; but a man that hath renuing grace he is kept from ſinne willingly; he is as willing to leave a luſt as a ſlave the gally, a priſoner the dungeon, or a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his rags; whereas a wicked man ſtill in his natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth as unwillingly leave his ſin, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did put <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> out of dores, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.11. and as <hi>Phaltiel</hi> did take his leave of <hi>Michal,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.16. where it is ſaid that he followed <hi>her weeping;</hi> even as the mariner doth caſt his goods over board in a ſtorme, becauſe he cannot help it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Reſtraining grace though it keep a man from the act, yet it ſtirres up a more vehement eagerneſſe to commit that ſinne when the reſtraint is over; though the act be ſuſpended, yet the deſire is increaſed. Juſt as it is with a river, the more it is dammed up, with the force and violence it will returne greater to its former courſe: ſo reſtrained corruption, when the reſtraint is over, will returne upon a man with the greater eagerneſſe. And as it is with a Smiths forge, if ye caſt much water upon it, it will quench the fire; but if you do but ſprinkle ſome wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it cauſes the fire to burne the hotter: ſo it is with reſtraining grace, it lets the luſt out with greater violence; renuing grace it ſuppreſſeth not only the act, but takes away the impetuous and eager deſire of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:115133:144"/>6. Reſtraining grace it is but partial, whether you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the ſubject, or the object.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the ſubject, reſtraining grace it bindes but one part of a man, and leaves the other looſe; it bindes the tongue, but not the hand; it bindes the hand, but not the ear and eye; it bindes only one part of a man, and not another: But now renuing grace, it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal, <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.23. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Ezek. 36.26.</note> and reaches to th whole man; it is a throughout work, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>The very God of peace ſanctifie you throughout, both in body, ſoul, and ſpirit;</hi> the work of Regeneration is not a new tongue, or a new eare, but all is become new in a new heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Reſtraining grace it is partial in that it reaches but to part of the object, as thus: it reaches but to ſome ſins, not to all; it keeps a man from one ſin, and gives him ſcope to another: But renuing grace it is univerſal; as it keeps under one ſinne, ſo it will labour to keep under all ſins; <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.3.</note> this is the particular and proper work of renuing grace, that a man is thereby inabled to have reſpect unto all Gods commandments.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Reſtraining and renuing grace they differ in their ends, and that two wayes.

                        <item>2. In regard of mans end.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. In regard of Gods end. Gods end in giving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining grace is to maintaine humane ſocieties for the good of others; but Gods end in giving renuing grace is, that mans nature might be ſanctified, and that man may be ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They differ in regard of mans end. As firſt the end of men that have reſtraining grace, is, that they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their ſouls in ſafety; but a godly mans end in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under ſinne is, that he may keep the peace of his ſoul; and this was <hi>Jabez</hi> his end; you finde it mentioned in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.10. He <hi>called upon the God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaying, Oh that thou wouldſt bleſſe me indeed, and inlarge my coaſt, and that thy hand might be with me, and that thou wouldſt
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:115133:144"/>keep me from evil that it may not grieve me!</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Chron. 4.10.</note> A godly man aimes at the peace and purity of his ſoul; but a wicked mans end is, only that he might have his ſoul not diſturbed by the preſent trouble for ſin, and condemned for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of ſin.</p>

                     </label> For the Uſe of this point, I ſhall firſt give you ſome general Poſitions, about the Spirits keeping of men from ſin, and then ſhall give you ſome particular Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                  <p>Seeing that the Spirit of God doth often keep rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men that they cannot do the evill they would; Then</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You may gather hence, that a man is not able to keep himſelf. Hence Chriſt prayes to his Father for his people, <hi>not that he would take them out of the world, but keep them from the evil:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 17.15.</note> We are not able to keep our ſelves; and this the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> acknowledgeth, ſaying, <hi>O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: it is not in man that walkech to direct his ſteps.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 10.23.</note> We cannot keep our ſelves from do committing evil.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Spirits keeping of us from evil, doth not exclude our care and endeavour to keep our ſelves. The Lord he makes a gracious Promiſe, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.9.</note> that <hi>he will keep the feet of his ſervants;</hi> and yet the Scripture tells you, that it is their care, and their duty alſo, <hi>to make ſtreight paths for their feet, and to ponder the path of our feet,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 4.23.</note> as <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it. Hence you finde in Scripture, Promiſes not only of what God will do, and of Chriſts Prayer that you may be delivered from evil; but of the practice of the godly, and their care in keeping themſelves; <note place="margin">1 John 5.18.</note> and this is their duty, <hi>He that is begotten of God keepeth himſelf;</hi> and as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Little children, keep your ſelves.</hi> We muſt not truſt ſo in Gods keeping of us as to be idle, but we muſt labour to keep our ſelves, as the Pſalmiſt did, who kept himſelf from his iniquity. <note place="margin">Pſalm. 18.23.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a great evidence of integrity and ſincerity of heart, when men labour to keep themſelves from inward
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:115133:145"/>and conſtitution-ſins, as well as from groſſe ſins; and this <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>He kept himſelf from his iniquity;</hi> that is, from thoſe ſins which by conſtitution he was inclined to; and this was an argument of his great ſincerity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Conſider, that though the Spirit of God doth keep regenerate men from doing the evil they would, yet the inclination and will to do any evil, doth make us guilty in the ſight of God, as if we had actually done it. That in Scripture ſenſe is ſaid to be done, that is either purpoſed or intended to be done. A notable paſſage to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you have in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.9. <note place="margin">Ihſhua 24.9.</note> where it is ſaid, that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lack King of Moab waged warre againſt Iſrael;</hi> and yet if you read the Hiſtory, <note place="margin">Numb. 2.23. and 24. chap.</note> in the 22.23. and 24. <hi>chapters</hi> of <hi>Numbers,</hi> you ſhall not read one word of any ſuch war; Now the reconciliation of theſe two places are eaſie; <hi>Balack did not actually wage warre againſt Iſrael, but he did intend ſo to do,</hi> and therefore he hired <hi>Balaam</hi> to curſe the people; <hi>and then,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I ſhall prevaile.</hi> I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this to this purpoſe, that you may not think your ſelves guiltleſſe, ſo ye keep out of the act of ſin; but if ſo be you have a will, and an inclination to thoſe evils, you will be found guilty before God; and hereupon it is that Chriſt tells us, that <hi>He that is angry with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without a cauſe, is guilty of murther; and he that looks after a woman to luſt on her, hath committed adultery al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in his heart.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 5.22.</note>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 28.</note> This Poſition may greatly humble us; we are guilty of many actual ſins which we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and we are guilty of many ſins, which though we have not acted, yet have they been in our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and intentions, and theſe the Law of God will judge.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Judge not thy ſelf to be righteous and gracious, by bare reſtraints from ſin in particular actions; but if you would judge your ſelves, judge by the ordinary courſe of your lives. It is poſſible that in a particular act a good man may not be kept from that ſin, from which a wicked man may; and it is poſſible that a wicked man may do 
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:115133:145"/>that good, which a godly man may not be able to do: Now you are not to judge of your ſelves by particular acts, but by the conſtant courſe of your lives; for if you ſhould do otherwiſe, you would <hi>condemn the generation of the juſt.</hi> I ſhall give an example, by comparing together good King <hi>David,</hi> and wicked King <hi>Abimelech,</hi> they were both tempted to the ſame ſin; and ſhould you have gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at theſe two men by their particular reſtraints, you would have taken <hi>Abimelech</hi> for the good King, and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> for the bad King. <hi>Abimelech</hi> in his reſtraint was far better then <hi>David;</hi> it is ſaid of <hi>Abimelech</hi> that he took <hi>Sarah;</hi> he did not know that ſhe was <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife, but <hi>David</hi> did know that <hi>Bathſheba</hi> was the wife of <hi>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah;</hi> and then further, <hi>Abimelech</hi> the Heathen King, though he had <hi>Sarah</hi> in the houſe, yet the Scripture tells you he did not defile her: but <hi>David</hi> took <hi>Bathſheba</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his houſe, and was actually unclean with her: Now ſhould you look upon theſe two men in this particular caſe, you would judge <hi>Abimelech</hi> to be the gracious King, and <hi>David</hi> the Heathen King.—But now if you look upon <hi>David</hi> in the ordinary courſe of his life, he was far better then <hi>Abimelech;</hi> you are not therefore to paſſe a verdict upon any man that he is good or bad, by any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular act; that as it is a rule in Philoſophy, that one act doth not denominate; ſo when you go to judge of men you muſt not look upon a particular act, but upon the general ſcope and current of their lives. <note place="margin">Prov. 16.17.</note>

                  <p n="1">1. Bleſſe God that ever you have been croſſed in the doing of thoſe ſins which you would have committed. How near the brink of many a ſin hath many a godly man been at, when an occaſion and an inclination hath met together, but God hath put in a reſtraint? O bleſſe 
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:115133:146"/>God, it is the greateſt mercy next converting grace. It was the prayer of <hi>Jabez, O that thou wouldeſt bleſſe me indeed! and O that thou wouldest keep me from evil!</hi> let it be thy prayer alſo. Sometimes men are angry when they are kept from an intended ſin; and this is juſt as if a man going to execution, ſhould be angry with a man for ſtopping him in his way: Alas, poor man, thou art go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the execution of thy ſin, if any ſtop thee, 'tis the ſaving of thy ſoul, at leaſt the ſaving of thy peace, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bleſſe God. How did <hi>David</hi> bleſſe God, when he intended to have cut off <hi>Nabal</hi> and all his family, when <hi>Abigail</hi> came with ſmooth words and prevented him?

And ſo <hi>Moſes,</hi> he was noted to be <hi>the meekeſt man on earth,</hi> Numb. 12.3.

                  <p n="3">3. Pray unto God for the Spirit to do its office in thy ſoul, <note place="margin">Pſal. 106.33.</note> that the Spirit may keep thee from doing the evil thou wouldeſt. We read of <hi>David,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 19.13.</note> that he made this prayer, <hi>Lord, keep thy ſervant alſo from preſumptuous ſins.</hi> Thou haſt need to pray that the Spirit may check and curb thy corruptions when thou art tempted to ſin, becauſe there is no man, though never ſo good, that can ſtand by his own ſtrength, though never ſo great, and thereby a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void an evil when he is tempted to it, though never ſo foule. O therefore pray for preventing grace, that God would keep thee by his Spirit, that ſo thou mighteſt not do the works of the fleſh. And therefore Chriſt hath taught us to pray, <hi>Lord, deliver us from evil,</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, as this point refers to the unregenerate, who have only reſtraining grace to hinder them from ſin: Let even ſuch conſider what cauſe they have to bleſſe God for this mercy; though they ſhall go to hell, yet they have cauſe to bleſſe God for reſtraining grace on earth; for though it will not make you good; yet it will and doth make you leſſe evil; and though it cannot make you ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, yet it will make you good moral men.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall by Gods aſſiſtance in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon finiſh this point; and there is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one queſtion that depends upon the laſt caution <hi>I</hi> named in my laſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which was, that you ſhould not look upon the reſtraints of the Spirit in keeping you from ſin, to be the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and gracious work of the Spirit. And hereupon I ſhall anſwer this queſtion, and ſhew you what other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes there may be, beſides the renewing grace of the Spirit, that may keep wicked men from doing evil.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Men may be kept from wickedneſſe, from the power which a religious education hath had on them while they were young; when you are under the tuition of Parents or Maſters, or Governours, this may reſtrain men from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much evil. <note place="margin">2 King. 12.2.</note> You have an inſtance hereof in King <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoaſh; He did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord all the dayes wherein Jehoiada the Prieſt inſtructed him:</hi> All the dayes his Uncle lived he walked in the wayes of the Lord; but aſſoon as ever he was dead, he fell to work wickedneſſe. Thus you read concerning <hi>Paul, that he was according to the Law blameleſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.6.</note> that is, as to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward 
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115133:148"/>letter; now how came he to be thus? why, ſayes he, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quo ſemel eſt imbuta recens ſervabit odorem Teſta diu.</hi>—</note> 
                     <hi>I am an</hi> Hebrew <hi>of the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>and touching the law a Phariſee;</hi> that is, he was trained up in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the force of education had made <hi>Paul</hi> a man of a very good moral life. And ſo the young man he ſaith to Chriſt that all the Commandments he had kept from his youth; this was the power of education, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.19,20. <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> A colt if he be never taken, nor tamed with bit nor bridle, will be a very ſavage and wilde creature all his life-time; and if you let him runne too long, he will hardly be tamed at all; but if you take up a colt when he is young, though he be wilde by nature, yet by breaking of him, you will make him fit for ſervice. It is true, religion doth not runne in a blood, yet the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it may; and this may be one cauſe why men do not the evil they would, becauſe a religious education hath a power to keep them back; yet this falls far ſhort of renuing grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Diſability of body, whether through age or ſickneſs, may be a meanes to reſtraine men from many ſinnes: <hi>Ambroſe</hi> calls diſeaſes the ſhops of vertue. Indeed ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it is a priſon, but not a grave to ſinne; it is only mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification which is a ſlaughter-houſe to ſinne, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Morbi virtutis officinae.</hi> Ambr.</note> ſickneſſe keeps ſinne in; when men are faſtened to their beds, and when their bones are made to rattle in their skin, they have then no pleaſure, nor leiſure left them to think of Luxurious exceſſe: Thus we ſee in <hi>Abimelech,</hi> how God kept him by laying ſome ſickneſſe or other upon him. <note place="margin">Gen. 20.6. compared with verſ. 17.</note> This you ſee by comparing <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.6. with the 17. <hi>ver.</hi> of that Chapter. In <hi>ver.</hi> 6. God told <hi>Abimelech, that he withheld him from ſinne;</hi> there it is only ſaid in the generall, that God reſtrained him; but in <hi>ver.</hi> 17. is hinted the manner how God did this; <hi>Abimelech</hi> would faine have defiled <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife; but God laid ſome diſeaſe upon him, and therefore it is ſaid that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham prayed unto God,and God healed</hi> Abimelech. <note place="margin">Rivet.</note>
                     <hi>Rivet</hi> upon theſe words ſaith, that aſſoone as ever he took
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:115133:148"/>
                     <hi>Sarah</hi> into his houſe, God ſmote him with a ſore ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo that he was not able to commit folly with her: And he gives this reaſon; becauſe <hi>Iſaac</hi> was the promiſed ſeed; and if <hi>Abimelech</hi> ſhould have laine with <hi>Sarah,</hi> the childe would have been thought <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi>'s, and not <hi>Abrahams;</hi> and therefore God did ſend ſome exquiſite diſeaſe upon him, that ſo he might be diſabled to his intended folly.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Outward meanneſſe and poverty of a mans preſent condition, is a cauſe to hinder many men from ſinne; whereas if they had wealth, they would work wickedneſſe with greedineſſe. And this was <hi>Hazaels</hi> condition; while he was a ſervant, he could not then do much miſchiefe, his outward condition was ſo mean that he had not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and advantage, <note place="margin">2 King. 8.12.</note> but when he came to be King in his Maſters roome; Then <hi>ſhalt thou burne the City, rip up women with childe, and daſh children againſt the ſtones;</hi> he never thought he ſhould have been ſo bad; but when he came to be King he did this and much more: We may bleſſe God, as it is a common proverb, <hi>That curſt cowes have but ſhort hornes;</hi> that wicked men are not ſometimes rich men, and great in place and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, God many times ſo orders it, that men that have much evil in their natures, ſhould not have opportunity to act it in their lives.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another way whereby men may be kept from ſin, may be from the affrightment of a natural conſcience; Gods Spirit doth not only ſometimes witneſſe with the ſpirit in godly men, but alſo checks the ſpirits of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men; and though a wicked man doth not forbeare to act ſinne obedientially, with any reſpect to the command of God; yet he forbeares to ſinne rationally, out of conviction from a natural conſcience. Natural conſcience it is that which over-rules and ſwayes a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, ſo that he ſhall not do the evil he would; the Gentiles, <hi>having not the law;</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, that is the written law, <note place="margin">Rom. 2.14.</note> 
                     <hi>yet they do by nature the things contained in
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:115133:149"/>the law, and theſe having not the law, are a law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> theſe <hi>Gentiles,</hi> though heathens, the Scripture ſayes they were a law unto themſelves, that is they have a conſcience which is inſtead of a law to them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The feare which is implanted in men of humane lawes, and penal ſtatutes is another meanes to keep men from much ſinne; when a divine law cannot bear ſway with a wicked mans conſcience, a humane law will reſtraine his practice; if it were not ſo, how many murthers would there be, were it not more for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing <hi>their neck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> then <hi>their ſouls?</hi> It is a mercy to have good lawes in a Nation, becauſe they reſtraine men from the practice of evil, when the law of God hath not a ſway upon mens conſciences. You finde in Scripture how men have been reſtrained meerly upon this account; the favourites of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon</hi> inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt <hi>Shadrach, Meſhech,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 3.29.</note> touching their God, there was an order made that the three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould be caſt into the fiery furnace, and that it ſhould be ſeven times more hotter then formerly; well, they were caſt in, and the ſtory tells you, that they walked in the fire as in a pleaſant roome. Now this did ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the King and his Nobles, that the King made this law, and ſent out this Edict, that every People, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and language which ſpake any thing amiſſe againſt the <hi>God of</hi> Shadrach, <hi>Meſhech, and Abednego,</hi> they ſhall be cut in pieces, and their houſes be made a dunghill; here was a humane law, and this did ſo quell, and awe the people, that though they did raile againſt the God of <hi>Shadrach, Meſhech,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> before, yet now they were ſilent: I only mention this to ſhew what force and power a humane law hath to reſtraine the ſin of wicked men.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Men may be kept from ſin, meerly by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and example of good men among whom they live; who do take notice of, and obſerve their wayes. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that it is reported as a proverb among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi>
                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:115133:149"/>they will ſay, Take heed, <hi>Cato</hi> beholds you. <hi>Cato</hi> who was eſteemed a good man, and being ſo eſteemed, when any man was doing evil, this was their Proverb, Take heed, <hi>Cato</hi> ſees you. And thus you finde in Scripture concerning <hi>Herod,</hi> that he feared <hi>John, knowing that he was a juſt man, and an holy, and obſerved him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 6.20.</note> We have a ſtory in the book of Martyrs in the beginning of the firſt vollume, concerning <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt who wrote the Revelation; as he was riding upon the high way, a company of thieves met with him; and it ſo happened that the Captain of theſe thieves was a youth which lived under <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtery; and though <hi>John</hi> hardly knew him, yet he knew <hi>Iohn;</hi> and it is ſaid, when he ſaw the old man, he ran away; the guilt of his conſcience did ſo recoile upon him, and the preſence of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that he ranne away, not daring to act his accuſtomed wickedneſſe. To this purpoſe is that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, It is good to be zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly affected alwayes in a good thing, and not only when I am preſent with you.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gai. 4.18. Phil. 1.27. Phil. 2.12.</note> It intimates that whileſt <hi>Paul</hi> was preſent, they walked marvellous well; but when he was abſent, they then grew idle; the preſence and example of good men is an occaſion many times to keep others from ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Men may be kept from ſinne, from an heroickneſſe of Spirit, and from the ingenuouſneſſe of a mans natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral temper. And thus <hi>Luther</hi> before converſion, whilſt he was a Monk in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet he profeſſes that then he was never tainted with <hi>covetouſneſſe;</hi> he was of ſo ingenuous a ſpirit, that ſuch a ſordid ſinne did not cleave to him. And ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> he tells you of a natural gift which he had, which was continency. Thus it is reported of <hi>Plutarch</hi> that he ſhould ſay. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Malo nullumſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſe</hi> Plutar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chum, &amp;c. Rom. 2.14.</note> 
                     <hi>I had rather you ſhould ſay there is no ſuch man in the world, then to ſay that</hi> Pſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tarch <hi>is either vaine, unjuſt, or uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant;</hi> the natural temper of the man did incline him to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and juſtice. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſayes, <hi>that though they had not the Law, yet they did by nature the 
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:115133:150"/>things contained in the Law;</hi> that is, by a refined nature. What is the reaſon that ſome men are paſſionate, and others not? the reaſon is not from renuing grace; but it is, becauſe there is in ſome a more ingenuouſneſſe of ſpirit then in others; and hereby many evils as to the act of them are reſtrained, though men be deſtitute of renuing grace.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Wicked men they may be kept from doing evil, for feare of puniſhment, either temporal or eternal; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fear of outward judgements: and thus it was with the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

So we read the High Prieſts and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, <note place="margin">Mat. 26.5.</note> they would not kill Chriſt upon a feaſt-day, <hi>leſt there ſhould be an uproar among the people;</hi> it was not love to Chriſt, but love to themſelves. So many Polititians they would do many injurious acts, were it not that they feared the people.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The fear of hell, and Gods wrath, that may lie hard on the ſoul of a ſinner, and may keep him from doing wickedneſſe, fear of everlaſting burnings. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you have a notable paſſage of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, The ſinners in</hi> Sion, ſaies he, <hi>are afraid, fearfulneſſe hath ſurprized the hypocrites;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 3.3.14.</note> what? what's the matter? This is the reaſon, <hi>Who among us can dwell with devouring fire? who can dwell with everlaſting barnings?</hi> The feare of Gods wrath made them afraid of ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Hope of temporal and eternal reward may be another cauſe why men may forbear ſinne. <note place="margin">Mark. 10.17.</note> And this was the conceit of that young man: <hi>What ſhall I do, that I may inherit eternal life!</hi> Chriſt anſwers him, <hi>Thou knoweſt the Commandments, Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not ſteale:</hi> and he anſwers, <hi>All theſe have I kept from my youth;</hi> he had more regard to the reward then to the rule in his obedience of the Commmandments.

                     <pb n="289" facs="tcp:115133:150"/>his hope in a happy end did curb him that he did not commit an unrighteous act. Upon all theſe forementioned occaſions wicked men may refraine from ſinne; ſuch who are wholly without any truth of grace.</p>

This objection may come from the heart of many a good man; and to this I ſhall lay down three or foure words by way of anſwer, and comfort, and ſo conclude all.</p>

                     </label> 1. Conſider, that to perceive the unbridled workings of ſinne in your natures, doth not argue the increaſe of ſinne; but your increaſe of light, and tenderneſſe in conſcience. <hi>Paul</hi> while he was unconverted, thought himſelf alive, and in a very happy condition before he ſaw the ſpirituality <hi>of the Law;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.9.</note> but when he was convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>When the Commandment came, ſin revived, and then he died;</hi> that is, the Law coming in power upon his conſcience he then ſaw ſin alive, and yet then he was in a converted eſtate and in a happy condition. As light breaking into a roome doth diſcover what wants and diſorders are there, which were unknown, and unſeen in the dark: ſo doth light breaking into the underſtanding, diſcover our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wants.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Do not judge your ſelves to be in a bad eſtate, by the want of particular reſtraints under ſinne; but judge your ſelves by the powerful manifeſtations of habitual grace in your more ordinary and conſtant courſe and practice. It may be one man can bridle his paſſion, but thou canſt not; yet he may be a bad man, and thou a good 
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:115133:151"/>man. A traveller perhaps may ſometimes ſtep into a wheel-tract, but his ordinary courſe is in the beaten road: ſo if thou falleſt into ſin, and wanteſt reſtraining grace, this may be thy falling into a wheele-tract; <note place="margin">Prov. 16.17.</note> thy ordinary way is the beaten path. It being <hi>the high way of the upright to depart from evil;</hi> yet now &amp; then thou maiſt loſe thy way. You are not to judge of your ſelves by particular acts of reſtraint.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though thou art overtaken with a ſin when other men are not, who are worſe then thy ſelf; yet conſider, thou haſt more temptations unto ſin then other men have. It is true, in ſome caſes a godly mans ſins they are more to be aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated then a wicked mans, yet in other caſes a godly mans ſin is not ſo to be aggravated. The devil is more ſolicitous to tempt a godſy man to ſin, then he is a wicked man. <note place="margin">Job. 1. Zeck. 3.1,2.</note> When the ſons of God came together, the devil came alſo in the midſt of them. He owes them a ſpite; and therefore if they be now and then overtaken, they ſhould not judge themſelves by thoſe particular acts, but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant courſe of their lives.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider, though thou doeſt yield to a ſinful act, <note place="margin">Rom. 7. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                        </gap>.</note> yet if ſin be not a Tyrant, nor a Lord over thee, thou haſt no cauſe to fear. Thou yieldeſt to ſin as to <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper,</hi> not as to thy <hi>Liege Lord;</hi> though thou wanteſt the reſtraint of the Spirit in ſome particular acts to keep thee from evil, yet if thou art kept by God from the reigning power of ſin: be not diſcouraged, thou art in a happy condition.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let this be your comfort; though now and then thou canſt not reſtraine the acts of ſin, yet ere long thou ſhalt be a compleat conquerour over all thy ſins; God ſhall tread down Satan under thy feet ſhortly; now thou fighteſt with the devil hand to hand, but then thou ſhalt trample him under thy feet: and let this be your comfort, who have <hi>the Spirit luſting againſt the Fleſh;</hi> your combate is but ſhort, your victory is certaine, your conqueſt is great, and your reward, and Crown everlaſting.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have choſen this place of Scripture, intending through Gods aſſiſtance, to make many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons upon it, being a Text that affords us ſo much variety of matter; but I ſhall not ſtand long upon any one particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, becauſe I would gladly end it, in ſome convenient time.</p>
                  <p>This Text may well be called <hi>A Chriſtians Directory,</hi> to guide and direct him, in his ordinary courſe, and walking through all the various mutations, viciſſitudes &amp; alterations, he may meet withall here in the world, whatſoever his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be, here is matter of advice and Counſel for him. If he meets with croſſes, troubles and afflictions, then his duty is to <hi>weep as if he wept not;</hi> if he meet with a gale of proſperity,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115133:157"/>with an affluence and confluence of all outward happineſs, then his duty is to <hi>rejoyce as if he rejoyced not.</hi> If he be a Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and by buying and ſelling, and trading in the world, he gets a great eſtate: then his duty is, to uſe his wealth ſo <hi>as if he poſſeſſed it not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And leaſt theſe particular caſes and directions ſhould not reach every mans particular condition: therefore the Apoſtle gives this generall rule to all that have any thing to do in the world, whether in one kind or other, that <hi>they that uſe this world, muſt uſe it, as not abuſing of it, becauſe the faſhion of this world paſſeth away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here you ſee what work I have cut out to you, which will afford abundance of matter, I ſhall only at preſent, make a ſhort entrance into the firſt direction the Apoſtle here gives to thoſe that meet with croſſes and afflictions in the world, namely, that <hi>they that weep be as if they wept not.</hi> There is ſome diſagreement in opinion amongſt interpreters, touching the ſcope of theſe words. <hi>Pareus</hi> thinks this Text hath a ſpecial reference to mariage, though it be intenſive alſo to all ſorts and conditions of people in the world, yet he thinks it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a nearer relation to men in a conjugall condition. A man in a maried eſtate muſt look to meet with cares and croſſes, and troubles, as the Apoſtle intimates in the next verſe but one to my Text, <note place="margin">Verſ. 3.</note> and therefore he gives this advice; you that are in a maried eſtate, and do meet with troubles and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the ſame, why, <hi>you muſt weep as if you wept not,</hi> you muſt mourn regularly and moderately; ſuppoſe you meet with troubles and afflictions, as a froward wife; or if you have a good wife, yet no Children by her, or if you have, they are bad Children; or if they be good; they die, God takes them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from you; or if they live, they take pernitious courſes, and are a grief and ſorrow, and vexation to you: why in all theſe or the like conditions, you ſhould ſo moderate your ſorrows, as to <hi>weep as if you wept not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And (truly beloved) the ſcope of the Chapter caries the ſence this way; and from hence I might note to you.</p>

                  <p>In the handling of this, it may be I may come near the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms of many of you, ſome of you (it may be) are troubled for want of trading, that you are not able to buy bread to put in your mouths: others troubled for loſſes, ſome for croſſes and afflictions, ſome for outward, others for inward troubles: why, in all theſe conditions, you muſt <hi>weep as if you wept not,</hi> you muſt have a care of immoderateneſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiveneſs in all your ſorrows.</p>
                  <p>Before I ſhall diſcuſs thoſe quaeries I intend about this Doctrine, I ſhall firſt lay down three concluſions concerning it.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Con. </seg>1</label> That this Doctrine doth not deny a naturall ſenſibleneſs of any croſſes or afflictions you meet with. (Beloved) God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115133:158"/>would not have you ſtupid and inſenſible under his hand: this Doctrine of <hi>weeping as if you wept not,</hi> doth allow of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſenſibleneſs of any croſſe or affliction that befalls us, God would have none to be ſtoically inſenſible of heart.</p>

Take this Concluſion, that the people of God are more able to bear afflictions and croſſes, at one time, then they are at another. It was the caſe of <hi>David,</hi> at one time when <hi>Abſalom</hi> was dead, he cryed out with great impatiency in the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.33. <hi>Oh Abſalom my Son, my Son, oh Abſalom, would to God I had died for thee my Son, my Son.</hi>

Inordinate and immoderate ſorrow for any affliction doth many times provoke God to lay on greater and heavier afflictions upon a people; it is the way to provoke the Lord to double his ſtroaks upon you, to make your burdens hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier, and your bondage greater. God deals with us, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deals with his Child; if the Father ſees that the Child beares his corrections kindly, he will give him the leſſe; but if he be ſtubborn, and frets and takes on, it will not make the Father leſſen his ſtroaks, but to give him more and more: ſo if we do patiently bear the indignation of the Lord in theſe afflictions he layes upon us, it is the way to have them alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated; but if we repine and murmure againſt God, and are immoderate in our ſorrows, this is the way to have them increaſed.</p>

                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> I ſhall lay it down to you in theſe five particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then is your ſorrow inordinate and exceſſive, when it laies you under great indiſpoſition of heart, to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of religious duties; when it makes you unfit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed to holy duties; and eſpecially theſe two, hearing the word and private prayer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When it indiſpoſeth you for hearing the word of God, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Moſes ſpake unto the Children of Iſrael, but they hearkened not unto him, for anguiſh of ſpirit, and for cruel bondage.</hi> The people were ſo grieved and over-preſſed with ſorrow, that what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake to them from the Lord, they did not regard it, becauſe of their afflictions and great bondage: Now if ever any ſorrow or croſſe went ſo near thy heart, as to diſturb thee, and indiſpoſe thee to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods word, that hath been an immoderate ſorrow. And therefore it is a great ſin, and greatly to be reproved in thoſe that when any of their neareſt relations are dead, they are ſo dejected with ſorrow, as not to come to Church, in 3. or 4. Sabbath-dayes afterward, which is very uſuall with a great many. In <hi>Levit.</hi> the 21.1,2,3,4. The Lord command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, <hi>that there ſhould none be defiled for the dead amongſt his people.</hi> There was a cuſtom amongſt the Heathen, when any of their friends were dead, in token of lamentation and ſorrow, they would make their heads bald, and ſhave the corners of their beards, cut their fleſh, and the like; but God prohibits his people, the doing of theſe things, as ſhaving their heads, cutting the corners of their beards, and the like. When the duties of Religion, as hearing the word, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by your ſorrows for any worldly croſs, then look upon it, as an irregular ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When your ſorrow indiſpoſeth and keeps you from private prayer, then it is inordinate: as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.3,4. <hi>my ſpirit</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aſaph</hi>) <hi>is over-whelmed within me, and I am ſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115133:159"/>troubled that I cannot ſpeak.</hi> When troubles do ſo ſtop mens mouths that they cannot pray, or make known their wants to God, then it is an inordinate ſorrow: and you women eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, that are naturally more tender, and apt to grieve then men, do you look to it, if your ſorrows have been never ſo ſmall, yet if they have interrupted and kept you from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of God, and from private duties, they have been exceſſive and immoderate. So <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.13.14. We read of <hi>women that covered the Altar of the Lord with tears, with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and with crying out, &amp;c.</hi> 'tis not meant of godly, but of worldly ſorrow, women ſo grieved for the churliſhneſs and unkindneſs of their Husbands to them, that they covered the Altar with teares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now God regarded not ſuch ſervices, becauſe when ſorrow is exceſſive for affliction, there is then little or no ſorrow for ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Your ſorrows are then inordinate, when they ſwallow up your comforts in the preſent mercies of God which you do injoy. Thus it was with <hi>Ahabs</hi> ſorrow in the 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 21.4. you read there that <hi>Ahab was grieved and ſore diſpleaſed, becauſe he could not have Naboths Vineyard;</hi> and the Text ſaith, <hi>he went home, and laid him down upon his bed, turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his face, and would eat no bread;</hi> though <hi>Ahab</hi> was a King, had a goodly Palace, and had Vineyards enough of his own, yet becauſe he could not enjoy <hi>Naboths,</hi> he could take no pleaſure nor comfort in thoſe he had. Thus good old <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> did ſo exceſſively mourn for <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who in his thoughts was dead, that though <hi>all his Sonnes and Daughters came to comfort him, yet he refuſed to be comforted;</hi> but ſaid, <hi>he would go mourning to his grave.</hi> The loſſe of one Child did ſwallow up the comfort of all the other eleven Sonnes. <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.35. If the ſenſe of the preſent ſorrows and afflictions you lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, be ſo great, that they ſwallow up all the mercies, and preſent comforts you injoy, then are your ſorrows inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Some people are ſo over-whelmed with a few light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, that they forget the many great mercies they injoy: many men that are worth ten thouſand pound, if they ſhould loſe but one thouſand pound, it would ſo trouble them,
<pb facs="tcp:115133:159"/>that they would take no comfort in all the reſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When your ſorrows for worldly loſſes or croſſes, put you upon ſinfull ſhifts and wicked courſes, to make up and repair your loſſe again, then look upon it as an immoderate ſorrow. <note place="margin">1 Sam. 28.6,7,8.</note> Thus <hi>Saul</hi> when he was in great trouble and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity of mind, and could not tell what to do, then he went to the witch at <hi>Endor</hi> for help, which did declare his ſorrow to be immoderate. Look to it, you that have met with great loſſes in the world, and undergone great afflictions and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, if theſe have made you run to ſinfull courſes, to repair your loſſes, or lighten your afflictions, then your ſorrow hath been exceſſive: as it may be you are in debt, and not able to maintain your ſelf and Family by your Trade: and therefore you will betake your ſelf to ſinfull ſhifts and deceits, as falſe weights, falſe lights, falſe meaſures, or the like, to repair your loſſes; if it be ſo, your ſorrows are immoderate.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Then your ſorrows are immoderate, when you do ſo grieve for your own trouble and afflictions, as to carry no compaſſion in your breaſt towards the afflictions of others, when thy Family loſſes do ſo afflict thee, that all the publick loſſes of Church and State do not at all affect thee, when thy own private and perſonall afflictions do ſo trouble thee, that come what will to the Church or Kingdom wherein thou liveſt, thou careſt not: when thou canſt ſhed a flood of tears for thine own miſery, but not a drop for the miſery of the Church of God, then are thy ſorrows inordinate and irregular.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When you are ſo ſenſible of your own afflictions, as to think no bodies afflictions are ſo great as yours, then are your ſorrows irregular. When you are like theſe in <hi>Lament.</hi> 1.12. that ſay, <hi>come and ſee if there be any ſorrow, any affliction like unto mine wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me.</hi> When you ſhall ſay, never did any man loſe ſuch an Eſtate as I have done, or ſuch a loving Husband, or Wife, or Children as I have done; never did any undergoe ſuch troubles and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as I have done, then are your ſorrows immoderate. But I ſhall ſhew you hereafter, that there are others that have loſt more, and ſuffered more, and undergone greater afflictions, 
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115133:160"/>and have greater cauſe to complain then you; but thus much ſhall ſerve for the firſt Query.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt </seg>2</label> I come now to the 2d, why Chriſtians ſhould take heed of this diſtemper, of being immoderate and exceſſive in their ſorrows for any affliction.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> 1. Becauſe immoderate ſorrow for the things of the world does proceed from evill cauſes. And 2dly does produce evill effects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It proceeds from evill cauſes, and thoſe are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From an immoderate love to the things of the world; that, in the want, and for the loſſe whereof, you do too much grieve, it is a ſign you did too much love in the enjoyment of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.35. When <hi>Jacob</hi> ſuppoſed that his <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſlain, he ſo exceedingly mourned for him, that though all his Sonnes and Daughters roſe up to comfort him, yet he refuſed to be comforted, and ſaid, <hi>I will go down into the grave unto my Sonne mourning.</hi> And why did <hi>Jacob</hi> thus mourn for him, but becauſe he loved him more then all the reſt, it was his immoderate love to him, that made him ſorrow ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately. If your hearts be glued to the things of the world, you cannot part with them, but with a great deal of vexation and ſorrow. If thy ſorrow be exceſſive for the loſs of any thing, thy love was immoderate towards it in the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. <hi>John</hi> 11.35.36. when Chriſt came to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and he being dead, Chriſt wept: then ſaid the Jews, <hi>behold how he loved him,</hi> his weeping for him did manifeſt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his love to him: not that his love was exceſſive, <hi>I</hi> do not ſay ſo: yet this we may ſee from hence, that grief in the want of mercies proceeds from love in the enjoyment of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This immoderate ſorrow proceeds from a murmuring diſcontent at the dealing of Gods providence towards you; there is a claſhing between Gods will and yours, as if God did not ſo well know how to deal with you, as you do with your ſelves; elſe you would quietly ſubmit to his will.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another evill cauſe from whence this immoderate ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ariſeth is ignorance, both of the vanity of temporall 
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115133:160"/>things, and the reality of ſpirituall things: we diſcover thereby, that we think temporall things to have more worth in them, then indeed they have, and ſpirituall things leſſe.</p>
                  <p>But 2dly, As it proceeds from evill cauſes, ſo it produceth evill effects: there are theſe five evill effects that immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſorrow produceth, as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It prejudiceth your naturall health, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. <hi>godly ſorrow worketh repentance never to be repented of;</hi> but world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow cauſeth death. And <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>a ſorrowfull ſpirit drieth up the bones, Prov.</hi> 17.22. ſo ſaies <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.10. <hi>my life is ſpent with grief, and my years with ſighing, my bones are conſumed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a blemiſh to Religion for a Chriſtian to be exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in his ſorrows, for <hi>the joy of the Lord ſhould be his ſtrength.</hi> A godly Chriſtian hath alwayes cauſe of <hi>joy unſpeakable, and full of glory:</hi> therefore it is a blemiſh to Chriſtianity, to ſee a godly man overpreſſed with worldly ſorrow; it is an aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon Religion, for a godly man to hang down his head, for the loſſe of any outward things, as if he had no greater concernments to look after, no joy, nor comfort, nor happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to look after but here in this life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It exceedingly indiſpoſeth the heart to holy and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall duties, it hinders and interrupts you in hearing the word, and prayer, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.9. <hi>They hearkened not unto Moſes for anguiſh of ſpirit and cruel bondage, &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 77.4. <hi>I am ſo troubled that I cannot ſpeak.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Exceſſive ſorrow, imbitters thoſe ſweet and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mercies you do injoy, a thouſand mercies are buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the exceſſive ſorrow for one affliction: as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.35. the place before quoted, <hi>Jacob</hi> did ſo extreamly mourn for <hi>Joſeph</hi> his youngeſt Sonne, which he ſuppoſed to be dead, that though he had eleven Sonnes, and many Daughters, and all of them came to comfort him, yet he could take no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in any of them; but reſolved that his gray hairs ſhould go down to the grave in mourning for him: this one exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſorrow for <hi>Joſeph,</hi> did imbitter many mercies and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which he did injoy. So <hi>Eſther</hi> 5.13. though <hi>Haman</hi> 
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:115133:161"/>was admitted to the greateſt intimacy &amp; familiarity with the King, <hi>yet all this availed him nothing, ſo long as he ſaw Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai ſitting at the Kings Gate:</hi> in this regard many men diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a temper much like the <hi>Hedg-hog,</hi> which as naturaliſts tell us hath this property, it will gather a great many apples, or ſuch like fruit, upon his briſtles, and then go to a Hedge and eat them; but it is ſo mournfull a Creature, that if it chance but to let fall one of his apples by the way, it will ſo vex and trouble him, that he will throw down all the reſt. So many men, if they meet but with one croſs or affliction, it will make them throw away all the other mercies they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and take no comfort in any of them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Exceſſive ſorrow for worldly croſſes, provokes God many times to ſend heavier and greater afflictions then ever yet you ſuffered. As I told you before, a ſtubborn Child, that blubbers and cries, and murmurs under the Fathers cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, will fare the worſe, and have the more blowes for it; ſo the more we repine and immoderately grieve for any worldly afflictions, the more croſſes and troubles we are like to have. And thus I have done with the ſecond queſtion, why Chriſtians ſhould take heed of immoderacie and exceſſiveneſs in worldly ſorrows. We come now to lay down ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations whereby to allay your ſorrows; but I muſt leave that till the afternoon, I ſhall onely for the preſent, make a ſhort application of what hath been ſaid, and ſo have done.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Is it ſo, that Chriſtians ſhould not be exceſſive in worldly ſorrows, but <hi>weep as if they wept not:</hi> then this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves thoſe that can mourn for every croſſe that befalls them; but yet cannot ſhed a teare for any ſin they commit. Many men complain of ſmall inconſiderable troubles and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; but yet never complain of their ſins and corruptions: theſe never trouble them, nor come near their hearts, they can mourn for that which can but at moſt prejudice the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and yet never grieve for that which can prejudice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their ſoules.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I beſeech you beloved, take heed of being laviſh of your
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115133:161"/>teares for worldly croſſes or afflictions, it is pitty to waſh a foul Room with ſweet water. <hi>I</hi> muſt needs tell you teares are too pretious to ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d for every trifle: it were a great deal better you would keep this pretious water to waſh away your ſins; for though it is Chriſts blood alone that can waſh away the guilt of ſin, yet your teares may much conduce to waſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the filth and power of ſin. When you mourn for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly croſſes, then <hi>weep as if you wept not;</hi> but when you mourn for ſin, mourn as much as you can. Be like yee before the Sun, that will ſoon melt and convert into water: you that are the Children of God know, that you have greater things, and of higher concernment to beſtow your teares upon, then any outward troubles; you have daily failings, and many ſins and corruptions unmortified and unſubdued, and the loſſe of the light of Gods countenance to mourn for, your ſorrows never run aright, but when they run in this Channel, when your tears run into the Mill-pond, to grind your luſts and corruptions, to conſume and weaken them, then are your ſorrows right and regular.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Let me intreat and adviſe you not to miſtake in reference to your ſorrows, to think you do mourn and grieve for ſin, when it is only for outward afflictions. Many men when their Neighbours aske them why they are ſo ſad and mournfull, and weep ſo much, will be ready to ſay, it is for their ſins and failings, and corruptions that are too ſtrong for them, or the like, when indeed it is only for ſome croſſe or outward trouble they have met with: therefore do not miſtake that ſorrow to be for your ſins, which is onely or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially for ſome outward affliction you have met with.</p>

Conſider, that you have had more mercies in your life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to chear you up, then ever you have had croſſes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort you: this conſideration did ſtrongly work upon <hi>Job,</hi> to ſupport his ſpirits under afflictions, ſaies he, <hi>ſhall we receive good at the hands of God, and ſhall we not receive evill?</hi> I have read a ſtory of a man of 50 years of age, who lived 48. years and never knew what ſickneſs was; but all the two laſt years of his life, he was very ſickly, and very impatient under it; but at laſt he reaſon'd the caſe thus with himſelf, and ſaid, the Lord might have given me 48 years of ſickneſs, and but two years of health, but hath done the contrary; I will therefore rather admire the mercy of God, in giving me ſo long a time of health, then repine and murmur at him for giving me ſo ſhort a time of ſickneſs: the Lord doth ever leave with us more mercies then he takes from us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how ſhould this ſupport our ſpirits, ſeeing our mercies have been more and greater then ever our afflictions have been: what though the Lord doth now viſit me with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet I have had more yeers of health, then I have had of ſickneſs: what though I have loſt friends, why yet let me conſider, they have lived a great while with me: what though this or that comfort is taken from me, yet I have a great many more left ſtill. The Scripture is very ſenſible how apt we are to grieve overmuch, and therefore preſcribes this Rule to allay immoderate ſorrow, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.14. <hi>In the day of adverſity conſider;</hi> why? what muſt we conſider? <hi>that God hath ſet the one over againſt the other,</hi> (that is) though you are in afflictions now, yet he hath given you mercies heretofore,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115133:162"/>and it may be he will give you proſperity again, he hath bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced your preſent afflictions with former mercies, and if you ſet the mercies you have injoyed againſt the preſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions you ſuffer, you will find the tale of your mercies, to exceed the number of your ſufferings. <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.33.</note> When <hi>David</hi> cryed out in ſuch immoderate ſorrow for his Son, <hi>Oh Abſalom my Son, my Son, would to God I had died for thee my Son, my Son:</hi> if he had then likewiſe ſaid, <hi>oh Solomon my Son, my Son;</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſidered, what a good Son he had living: this would have been a great means to have quieted his ſpirit.

Would you be angry with that man that ſhould pull down your ſmoaky Cottage over your head, if he would erect a ſtately Pallace for you in the room of it; every mercy that God takes from you, he will give a greater for it: as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet told <hi>Amaziah,</hi> who expended his Eſtate on the <hi>Iſraelites, the Lord is able to give thee much more then this:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job 1.3. with cap. 42.12.</note> thus God dealt with <hi>Job,</hi> as you may ſee in the firſt and laſt Chapters of that Book, compared together, the Lord took away from <hi>Job</hi> 
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:115133:163"/>all his Eſtate and ſubſtance; but gave him twice as much as he took away from him: there was taken from him ſeven thouſand ſheep, and God gave him afterward fourteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand for them, he loſt 3000 Camells, he had afterwards 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So to <hi>David,</hi> had God given him the life of his Child, it would have been a living monument of his ſhame, that all that knew the Child would have ſaid, yonder goes <hi>Davids</hi> Baſtard.</p>
                  <p>I have heard a godly Miniſter relate a ſtory, that once he went to viſit a Neighbour of his, (whoſe Child lay a dying) to comfort her, ſhe was very much grieved and dejected with ſorrow, and would by no means be comforted: the Miniſter ſaid unto her, woman, why do you grieve ſo much? if your Child ſhould live, it may be God might make it a ſcourge and vexation to you, by taking wicked and ſinfull courſes; ſhe anſwered, ſhe did not care if her Child did recover, though he were hanged afterward: this her Son did reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and was afterward executed for ſome villany that he had committed: why now it had been a greater mercy, and a thouſand times better for her, to have ſeen him buried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then that he ſhould have come to ſuch an unhappy end.

You will ſay it is a childiſh thing for a man to cry for nothing; why many ſuch childiſh pranks do we play very often, we do grieve and mourn, and weep for meer nothings, which if we did ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider, when we do mourn for the loſſe of this or that comfort, it would allay our ſorrows, ſeeing they are meer nothing: Oh but you'l ſay, my Trade failes, ſo much of my Eſtate is loſt, and do you call this nothing? yes I do, for ſo the Scripture calls them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. ſaies <hi>Solomon, wilt thou ſet thy heart upon that which is nothing? for riches take unto them wings and fly away:</hi> and if ſo, why ſhould we ſet our hearts ſo much upon them, as to grieve for them in the want of them.

                  <p n="2">2. If you would keep your ſorrows within bounds, then take heed you do not place an inordinate and immoderate love, upon any comfort you enjoy here below. If you love any thing too much in the enjoyment of it, you will grieve too much for that thing in the loſſe of it, and therefore let not your hearts be glewed to any comfort here below. Let the comforts of the world be to you as Gloves to your hands, and not as the skin to your fleſh; you cannot pull off the skin from your fleſh without a great deal of pain and torment, but you may pull of your Glove from your hand without any trouble. If your hearts be glewed too much to the love of worldly things, the loſſe of thoſe things you did ſo immoderately love, will provoke you to exceſſive ſorrow and grief. A man will never grieve for the loſſe of that which he hates, but for that which he loves, and you can never keep your ſorrow within bounds, if you do not keep your love within bounds. As it is with a Picture, if you put it into a frame, and hang it up againſt the wall, you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily take it down again; but if you glew or paſt it to the wall, you cannot take it down without tearing it all to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115133:167"/>So if your love to the World be like a Picture, glewed to the wall, you will not part with the things of the world, but with a great deal of ſorrow and trouble and vexation. <note place="margin">Gen. 37.3.35.</note> It is ſaid of <hi>Jacob</hi> when he heard his Son <hi>Joſeph</hi> was dead, that he wept and would not be comforted, and the reaſon was, becauſe he loved <hi>Joſeph</hi> exceedingly, and more then all the reſt: his exceſſive love to <hi>Joſeph</hi> did make him ſorrow ſo much in the want of him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Look upon all comforts here below, <note place="margin">Scio me ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniſſe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telem.</note> as loſeable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. God in his wiſdom hath not joyned permanency to any comfort here below. Look upon your comforts as muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and periſhing: have you loſt a Child? why ſay, <hi>I</hi> knew before that I had begotten a mortall Child: there is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time for us all once to die, and the comforts we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy here below, are not like the Anchor in the bottom of the Sea that holds faſt in a ſtorm; but like the flag upon the top of the maſt that turns with every wind; and therefore ſeeing in your greateſt comfort you are ſubject to an alteration eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment, why ſhould you immoderately ſorrow in the loſſe of them, and grieve ſo much for that which you may loſe you know not how ſoon. A man ſhould ſit looſe from things loſeable, and never give way to certain ſorrows, for the loſſe of ſo uncertain comforts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If you would keep your ſorrow within bounds, conſider that you have no cauſe of ſorrow for the loſſe of worldly things, if God leaves you enough for the neceſſities of your life, though he doth not leave you a ſuperfluity for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and delight of your life, <hi>having food and rayment, let us therewith be content.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.8</note> If thou haſt bread, though not jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, be contented with it: if you have rayment, though not Ornaments, yet be contented. If you have food and rayment, though never ſo courſe, being enough but meerly to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain life, you have no cauſe to complain, but to be contented. <hi>Jacob</hi> was a richer man then any of you that hear me this day; yet ſaies he in <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20. <hi>if ſo be thou wilt give me bread to eat, and rayment to put on, it ſhall ſuffice me.</hi> If the Lord gives us meat and rayment, though the meat be homely, and the ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Oh Beloved, the letting your ſorrowes run out upon ſin, will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them from any other object, becauſe when once the ſoul is in a veine of weeping for ſin, it ſees and apprehends ſin to be ſo great an evill, that no evill in the world is ſo much a ground of ſorrow as that: and therefore if you would weep as if you wept not for outward troubles, weep more for ſin, and the corruptions that are in your own hearts; I may ſay of ſorrow as it is ſaid of feare in <hi>Eſay</hi> 8.12,13. ſayes the Text, <hi>Feare not their feare, neither be afraid, but ſanctifie the Lord of Hoſts himſelfe, and let him be your feare, and let him be your dread.</hi> They that feare the Lord will not feare men; they that have a religious feare, will not have a worldly feare: ſo if you have a godly ſorrow for ſin; it will keep you from any immoderate worldly ſorrow; and therefore I could wiſh, when you finde your ſorrowes breaking out for the loſſe of worldly comforts, and things goe croſſſe with you here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that you would conſider, that you have greater evils, to mourne for, and a great deale more cauſe to let your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes run in ſins Channell, then for any outward croſſe or affliction.</p>

                     </note>1. Where there is only a naturall ſenſibleneſſe a kindely grieving for worldly croſſes; it will rather animate and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſoule to religious duties, then any way indiſpoſe and interrupt them; and therefore it is that you ſo often finde weeping joyned with prayer and ſupplication in Scripture; thus it is ſaid, <hi>Iacob wept and made ſupplication,</hi> and in Jer. 3.21. <note place="margin">Hoſ. 12.4.</note> 
                     <hi>A voyce was heard upon the high places, weeping and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the children of Iſrael;</hi> ſo in Ier. 31.9. <hi>They ſhall come with weeping, and with ſupplication will I lead them.</hi> So in <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.5,6. it is ſaid, the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at <hi>Bochim, lift up their voyce and wept, and ſacrificed to the Lord.</hi> All which places ſhew, that that ſorrow which is onely a naturall ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of Gods hand will quicken and encourage the ſoule to duty, rather then indiſpoſe him; but now on the other ſide, exceſſive ſorrow renders a man unfit for prayer, reading, hearing the word, or any other holy duty. As in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.4. <hi>Aſaph was ſo overwhelmed with ſorrow, that he could not ſpeak.</hi> And <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.9. then is thy ſorrow immoderate, when it inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts thee in the performance of holy duties.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where there is onely a kindly grieving and a naturall ſenſibleneſſe of worldly croſſes, there is kindled in that mans heart a ſympathizing and fellow-feeling of other mens troubles; that man will carry compaſſionate bowels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards other men that are in trouble, as well as themſelves. <hi>Job</hi> 30.25. ſaies <hi>Job, did not I weep for him that was in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? was not my ſoule grieved for the poor?</hi> but now, where ſorrow is immoderate, you will ſo think upon your own troubles, that you will not pity any that are in the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with you.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where there is only a naturall ſenſibleneſſe of worldly croſſes, there is retained in that ſoule a fence of thoſe many mercies you doe enjoy, as well as of the afflictions and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings you doe endure: naturall ſenſibleneſſe of afflictions does not take away the comfort and enjoyment of preſent mercies; there is a ſenſe of mercies enjoyed, as well as of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions endured. But now, in immoderate ſorrow, the very ſenſe of your trouble and croſſes doth take away, and imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115133:172"/>all your former or preſent mercies. As in <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.12,13. <hi>Is it a ſmall thing, that thou haſt brought us out of a Land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderneſſe?</hi> Pray marke, for there is much of Gods mind in this place; the Land that theſe men ſpeak of here, is the land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where they were under bondage and ſlavery; and yet when they met with afflictions in the wilderneſſe, they forgot the bondage they were delivered from in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but ſaid, it was a Land flowing with milke and honey; immoderate ſorrow for afflictions doth quite take away all ſenſe of the mercies you doe enjoy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Where there is onely a naturall ſenſibleneſſe of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly croſſes, there prayer to God, or a promiſe from God, will quiet the heart. This you may ſee verified in <hi>Hannah,</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18,19. ſhe was grieved for a child, but what then? <hi>She prayed and ſaid, Let thine handmaid finde grace in thy ſight; ſo the woman went away and did eate, and her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was no more ſad.</hi> After ſhe had poured forth her heart in prayer to God, ſhe was comforted, ſhe went her way, and was no more ſad. Then is your ſorrow right, when going to God upon your knees will quiet your heart. Or,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When a promiſe from God will comfort you; thus it was with <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.50. ſaies he, <hi>This is my comfort in affliction, for thy word hath quickned me;</hi> that is, the word of a promiſe. So in <hi>Verſ.</hi> 92. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe thy law had been my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, I ſhould then have periſhed in my affliction.</hi> And in <hi>Verſe</hi> 107. <hi>I am afflicted very much, quicken me, O Lord, according to thy word.</hi> Then is your ſorrow moderate, when either a prayer to God, or a promiſe from God will quiet your hearts; and then are your ſorrows immoderate, when under any affliction all the promiſes in the Bible cannot quiet you; nor any prayer to God comfort you. And thus it was with <hi>Job,</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> 9.16. ſaies he, <hi>If I had called, and he had anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, yet would I not believe that he had hearkned unto my voyce.</hi> And therefore beloved look to it, you that have met with many worldly croſſes and troubles, and never a prayer could comfort you, nor promiſe quiet you, it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115133:172"/>that your ſorrows were immoderate.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Where there is only a naturall ſenſibleneſs of worldly croſſes, there that ſoule does notwithſtanding all his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons juſtifie God, and condemn himſelf, acknowledging his own ſin to be the cauſe of all croſſes: This you have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of in <hi>Lamen:</hi> 1.18. <hi>In all the evill that is come upon us the Lord is righteous;</hi> and in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.14. <hi>the Lord is righteous in all that is come upon us; for we have rebelled and done evill in his ſight:</hi> So <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51.3. <hi>I acknowledge my tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and my ſin is ever before me:</hi> then is your ſorrow right, when you can juſtifie God, and take ſhame to your ſelves. But now where ſorrow is vexatious and exceſſive, there a ſinner flies out againſt God, and rather juſtifies himſelf, there the finner accounts God very ſevere and cruel in his diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and murmures againſt him, thinks ill of him, and of his wayes; and in this condition was <hi>Job</hi> once, <hi>Job</hi> 16.17. <hi>He breaketh me with a tempeſt, and multiplieth my wounds without a cauſe,</hi> he blamed God and juſtified himſelf, which declared his ſorrow to be immoderate and exceſſive. You have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table paſſage for this in <hi>Eſay</hi> 8.21. it is ſaid, that when God ſhall bring afflictions and trouble upon the Land, <hi>then they ſhall curſe their King and their God, and look upward,</hi> they ſhall be ſo overcome with ſorrow, as that they ſhall curſe God, and juſtifie themſelves: ſo in <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.3. ſaies <hi>Solomon, the fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man perverteth his way, and his heart fretieth againſt the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Where there is only a naturall ſenſibleneſs under the hand of God, there will be an aptneſs to hearken to comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able counſel from the word of God to bear up the heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der afflictions; and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 33. when God laid afflictions upon him, <hi>he opened his ears to counſel;</hi> when you are ſo tamed by afflictions, that you will hear <hi>the voice of the rod,</hi> and the <hi>voice of the word,</hi> and hearken to any counſel that is tendered to you to bear up, and ſupport your ſpirits, then is your ſorrow regular, and ſuch as God allows of; but now where ſorrow is inordinate, that man is not fit to receive any inſtruction, from any friend that goes about to comfort
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115133:173"/>him. Thus <hi>Aſaph</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.2. when he was overwhelmed with ſorrow, <hi>his ſoul refuſed to be comforted,</hi> they are then like <hi>Rachel,</hi> that would not be comforted, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.18. <hi>In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her Children, and would not be comforted, becauſe they were not.</hi> The women of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> did weep and mourn, and would not be comforted, which did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence their ſorrow to be immoderate. When no promiſe in the Bible, no comfort nor ſupport from the word, will eaſe and quiet the heart, this ſhews that ſuch a ſpirit is too much overcome with ſorrow, vexation, and grief for worldly croſſes.</p>
                  <p>And thus <hi>I</hi> have done with the firſt caution, to take heed when you are over much grieved for worldly afflictions, that you do not then ſay it is only a naturall ſenſibleneſs of the hand of God upon you, and no more.</p>

Is it ſo that we muſt not be immoderate in our ſorrows for worldly croſſes? <hi>but muſt weep as if we wept not:</hi> then take heed ye do not judge that to be a mourning for ſin, which is only for outward troubles. And beloved, the reaſon why I give you this caution is, becauſe of that aptneſs and propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there is in people, when they have loſt Husband, or Wife, or Children, or Eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and are extreamly troubled and dejected. If you aske them, why they mourn and grieve ſo much? they will anſwer, it is for their ſins, and will ſay, what, will you not give me leave to mourn for my ſins? it is my ſin that is the cauſe of all my grief and ſorrow, and teares, and I hope you will allow me to do ſo? yes, mourn for your ſins in Gods name; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Caſe </seg>2</label> but becauſe men are apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves in this particular, I ſhall therefore handle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other caſe of conſcience concerning this; How you may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne when a man doth exceſſively ſorrow, whether he doth weep rather for his afflictions then for his ſin? rather for his troubles and worldly croſſes, then for his corruptions, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending and ſinning againſt God, I ſhall give you 4 plain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of ſuch a man.</p>

                        </gap>ies of men that mourn ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſin then for affliction.</note> rather for his ſin then for his afflictions, if ſo be that man did grieve and mourn for his ſins before ever he was afflicted. It is an Argument that your grief is rather for ſin, then for affliction, if when you were in proſperity, ſin did break your heart, and you could then have no reſt nor quietneſs within you, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your ſins: and thus <hi>David</hi> did mourn for his ſins, when he did water his couch with his teares, for defiling of <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhebah,</hi> for he had then no affliction or croſſe lay upon him, and yet <hi>David did roar in the diſquietneſs of his ſoul, and he had no reſt in his bones by reaſon of his ſin.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> ſate upon the Throne in worldly glory and proſperity, yet then could he lie in the duſt in ſpirituall ſhame, and this before the Child was ſick. And therefore if upon examination you finde that you did weep and mourn for your ſins and corruptions, before ever you had this or any other croſſe lying upon you, then you may conclude, that your ſorrow is more for ſin then for worldly afflictions; but now when a man ſhall pretend to grieve for ſin, and yet that mans ſins never troubled him all his lifetime before, his corruptions never grieved his heart, nor troubled his conſcience before, this ſhowes it is more for afflictions then for his ſin, that ſuch a man mourns and weeps.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Diſcov: </seg>2</label> 2. Then a man mourns rather for ſin, then for affliction, when he takes more care to remove his ſins from his ſoul, then his afflictions from his body. VVhen thou canſt make it the great requeſt of thy ſoul, and the care of thy heart, rather to have thy ſins removed then thy afflictions. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.2. <hi>Oh Lord take away all iniquity, and receive us graciouſly:</hi> they did not ſay, Oh Lord take away affliction, although they had many then upon them; but ſay they, <hi>Lord take away the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of thy Servants, and receive us graciouſly;</hi> but he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires rather to have his troubles removed then his ſins, it is a ſign he does not mourn for ſin, but for affliction. Thus <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> when the Judgements of God were upon him, when the Thunder and Hail came, and the froggs and lice, <note place="margin">Exo. 9.28.</note> and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain of Beaſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaies he to <hi>Moſes, intreat the Lord that there 
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115133:174"/>be no more mighty Thunderings and Hail:</hi> he deſired <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray to God to remove the plagues from him; but never deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that his ſin, and the hardneſs of his heart might be taken avvay. You that can cry out, oh Lord take avvay this croſſe, or this affliction from me; but never pray to have your ſins removed, and your corruptions ſubdued: this is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you mourn for affliction more then for ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If vvhen the committing of a ſin, and the removing of an affliction ſtand in competition together, you would rather have the affliction continued, then commit a ſin: this ſhevvs you grieve for ſin, rather then for affliction. As for inſtance, vvhen a man is brought to a lovv condition, and a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in the vvorld, his Trade fails, and his ſtock is ſpent, if that man be more troubled for his ſin that brought him into that condition, then for the affliction it ſelf, then he vvill not commit a ſin to repair and make up his loſſes, though he did knovv, that the committing of ſuch a ſin vvould do it; and ſo in any other caſe: as I have read a ſtory of a Noble man, whoſe Sonne and Heire was ſuppoſed to have been bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and being adviſed by ſome to go to a Witch, to have his Sonne helped and unbewitched again; he anſwered, no, by no means, for he had rather the Witch ſhould have his Sonne then the Devill. But if you make no conſcience to commit a ſin, to avoid or remove an affliction, if you will break the hedge of a command to avoid a little foul way of affliction, it is a ſign that you mourn for your croſſes and afflictions more then for your ſins, and that you never grieved ſo much for your corruptions as you have done for your corrections, <hi>Job</hi> 36.21. ſo thoſe that in their diſtreſs go to VVitches and VVizzards, and Fortune-tellers, as <hi>Saul</hi> did to the vvitch at <hi>Endor,</hi> ſhew that they grieve more for affliction then for ſin.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If you mourn for ſin, the true joy that ariſeth from the forgiveneſs of ſin, will ſwallow up the grief that comes to thee, through any worldly croſſe or affliction, and will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe make thee to undergoe them with patience. That man grieves for ſin moſt, who when his ſin is pardoned, grieves
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115133:174"/>leaſt for outward trouble; when the comfort of his ſins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs doth more rejoyce him, then the continuance of any affliction upon him, can grieve him: as in the 33 of <hi>Eſay,</hi> and the laſt, <hi>The Inhabitants ſhall not ſay</hi> I <hi>am ſick; for the people that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their iniquity:</hi> thoſe people they were like a Ship in a great tempeſt, their Maſt broken, and their ſails looſed, all their tackling loſt and gone; why? what then? yet <hi>the Inhabitants ſhall not ſay</hi> I <hi>am ſick,</hi> becauſe the Lord hath forgiven them their ſin, he doth not ſay, they ſhall not ſay they were ſick; but they ſhal not ſay they are ſick, becauſe their ſins are pardoned: the ſenſe of their pardon ſhould take away the ſenſe of their pains under their preſent ſufferings: now when it is thus with you, it is an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that your trouble was more for ſin, then for affliction. But then is a man more troubled for his afflictions, then for his ſins, when he will grieve, though he be aſſured that his ſins are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that he is an heir apparent unto glory. All the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions he hath of ſins forgiveneſs, doth no whit allay his impatience. And thus I have done with this ſecond caution, that you take heed you do not look upon that as a mourning for ſin, that is onely for ſome outward trouble and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
                  <p>Before I come to the third caution, give me leave to lay all cloſe to your hearts by a word or two of application, and the uſe that I ſhall make of what hath been ſaid in theſe two Queries, ſhall be firſt for reproof, <note place="margin">Uſe of Reproofe.</note> and then for exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

For reproof to thoſe that are ſo far from weeping as if they wept not for afflictions, that they weep ſo exceſſively, as if their whole bodies were made of a lump of Ice, that does all diſſolve into tears, when the Sun of affliction does ſcorch them. How many men are there that are eaſily drawn to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row immoderately for worldly croſſes. VVe uſe to ſay when a man weeps, that he waters his plants; and you know, that when you water your plants in your Garden too much, you drown and kill them, and ſo when you weep over much for afflictions, you drown your plants, and diſcompoſe your

                  <p n="2">2.

Obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſinners do not grieve at all, and aſſured Chriſtians they will not grieve too much, only diſconſolate and deſpairing ſinners do ſorrow over-much.</p>
                  <p>And here comes in the third caſe of conſcience, <note place="margin">Caſe of conſcience when Chriſtians may be ſaid to grieve too much for ſinne.</note> how or in what caſe a man may weep and ſorrow over-much for ſin.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall reſolve this caſe very briefly.</p>
                  <p n="1">Firſt, That ſorrow for ſin is exceſſive, that makes a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian pore ſo much upon his corruptions, that he over-looks his graces. A Child grieves too much when he ſo blubbers and cries, the tears trickling down his eyes, that he cannot ſee his Letters, nor read his Book: ſo a Chriſtian grieves too much for his corruptions, when he cannot ſee, nor bleſſe God for thoſe graces he gives him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You grieve over-much for ſin when it doth damne and darken your evidences for Heaven; when a Chriſtian does ſo pore upon his ſins, and diſcover ſuch cauſe of grief and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from them, that he never looks into his own heart to ſee what cauſe of joy he hath there, in having an aſſurance of his intereſt in Chriſt, and a right and title unto glory. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, God would not have one grace to juſtle out another, ſorrow for ſin is a grace; but yet God would not have this to juſtle out ſpirituall joy. When a Chriſtian does ſo grieve for ſin, that he caſts away all hopes of Heaven, then his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is exceſſive, when he grieves and blubbers ſo that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read his evidences for Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly, Sorrowing for ſin is exceſſive, when it laies diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements upon the ſoul to come in to Chriſt for pardon and remiſſion; when a man ſhall ſo grieve for ſin, that he 
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115133:176"/>dares not venture to look up to Jeſus Chriſt for mercy, and to lay hold upon a promiſe for his comfort, when a ſinner does thus, then he mourns exceſſively. If the Children of Iſrael in the wilderneſs, when they were ſtung of the fiery Serpents, had not had the boldneſs to look up to the Brazen Serpent, they could not have been healed and recovered; ſo when ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſin makes us that we cannot look up to Chriſt for pardon, then it is exceſſive. Sorrow and teares for ſin are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver right till they are like floods of water to drive us to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">Fourthly, ſorrow for ſin is then immoderate, when it ſo overwhelms you, that you can take no comfort in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſings that God hath given you, as Houſes or Lands, or Corne, or Wine, or the like.</p>
                  <p>When a Chriſtians ſorrow for ſin doth ſo damp his ſpirits, that he cannot take that outward joy and lawful complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in worldly comforts that God allowes him, then is your ſorrow inordinate: though many think that God allowes that ſin ſhould be ſo bitter to them, yet it is no ſuch matter, you muſt be ſorry for ſin, and yet take comfort in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſings that God beſtowes upon you.</p>
                  <p n="5">Fifthly, Sorrow for ſin is inordinate, when it puts a man into an incapacity to receive comforts from the Goſpel, when a Chriſtian ſhall ſee his ſin ſo great, and his caſe ſo ſad, that if you tender the promiſes of the Goſpel to him, they are as things of no worth to him, he thinks they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him, and therefore can find no comfort nor ſavour in any of them. When a man ſhall be obſtinate, and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſtand out againſt the comforts of the Goſpel becauſe of his ſin, then is his ſorrow inordinate. Thus <hi>Aſaph</hi> did in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.2. ſaies he, <hi>I was in trouble, and my ſoul refuſed to be comforted.</hi> When a mans condition is ſad, and yet he refuſeth to be comforted, then is his ſorrow exceſſive.</p>
                  <p n="6">Sixthly, Then is ſorrow for ſin immoderate, when it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, or indiſpoſeth a man to perform his duty, either in his generall or particular calling, when it doth indiſpoſe him to the duties of his generall calling as a Chriſtian, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115133:177"/>pray, nor read, nor diſcourſe, nor hear the word of God; but lies alone in a corner, and will not admit of any body to comfort him, or confer with him; that ſorrow that indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a man to holy duties, is an irregular ſorrow, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 77.4. <hi>I am ſo troubled that I cannot ſpeak,</hi> to wit, to God in prayer. And ſo again that ſorrow that indiſpoſeth a man to the duties of his particular Calling as a man, that he cannot work, or ſtudy, or trade, and follow his particular imployments, that ſorrow is an inordinate ſorrow. God doth require us to work in our Callings, as well as <hi>to work out our ſalvation:</hi> and therefore that ſorrow that hinders and indiſpoſeth us to it is exceſſive, and immoderate. And thus I have ſhewed you when ſorrow for ſin is exceſſive, and have onely given you the heads of things, and have likewiſe done in reſolving the third caſe of conſcience.</p>

                     </label> VVe come now to the application: and if it be ſo that a Chriſtian muſt not onely take heed of grieving overmuch for afflictions, but for ſin too, then take heed you do not pervert this Doctrine; take heed of being obſtinate and perverſe, and hard-hearted in ſin; though I tell you that Chriſtians ſhould not be exceſſive in their ſorrows for ſin; yet I do not ſay that wicked men ſhould be obſtinate and ſtout-hearted in ſin, and never mourn for ſin at all. No, it were well for them that they could weep bitterly for their ſins: therefore you that are obſtinate and preſumptuous ſinners, take heed that you do not abuſe this Doctrine; and again, you that count ſin your greateſt burthen, that every mole-hill of ſin is like a Mountain upon you, take heed that ye be not ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with ſorrow, that you can ſee no comfort at all in Chriſt, and in the promiſes of Salvation through him; but do you look to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſee that there is more in Chriſt to ſave you, then there is in your ſelves to condemn you; though there be abundance of corruption in you, yet there is a fullneſſe of ſatisfaction in Chriſt; <hi>he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſave to the uttermoſt all that ſhall come unto God by him.</hi> All you that do belong to Chriſt, do neither weep too much for your ſins, nor yet too little, do not ſay I will not grieve
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115133:177"/>nor ſhed tears at all for them; for as Chriſts blood was ſhed for our ſins, ſo we ſhould ſhed tears for them; but yet we muſt not ſo grieve for them, as to diſcourage us from going unto Chriſt, and to darken our evidences for Heaven.</p>

Conſider, that exceſſive ſorrow for worldly croſſes, argues either a totall want of grace, or elſe an extream weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of grace. Firſt, it ſometimes argues a totall want of grace. It is with a Chriſtian in this caſe, as it is with the ruſty hinges of a door: if you open or ſhut the door, they will skreak &amp; make a noiſe; but if you put ſome oyl upon them, they do not ſo: ſo Chriſtians many times, God cannot touch them with his rod of afflictions, but they cry out, and are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate in their ſorrows, and impatient under Gods hand, and the reaſon of it is, becauſe they want the Oyl of grace: or if it doth not argue a totall want of grace, yet it is a ſign of a great deal of weakneſs of grace; I have obſerved often times in <hi>London</hi> ſtreets, that a pair of new Cart wheels will skreak and make a noyſe as they go along; but an old Cart goes away ſilently. So if when God laies afflictions upon thee, thou art like a new Cart, that thou crieſt out, and mourneſt immoderately under his hand, it argues, that thou art but a new and a weak Chriſtian: <hi>he that faints in the day of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> ſaies <hi>Solomon, his ſtrength is ſmall.</hi> But now a Chriſtian that hath been long uſed and experienced in troubles and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, you may lay a great and heavy burden upon him, 
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115133:178"/>and he will make no noyſe under it.</p>

Another conſideration to keep out exceſſive ſorrow, is this; conſider that whatſoever croſſes befall you in the world, they are but the manifeſtations and executions of Gods will, which is the rule of order and juſtice, his diſpenſations are good and juſt in themſelves; if Gods will be done, though thy will be croſt, it is no matter. This was that which kept <hi>David</hi> from exceſſive ſorrow in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.21,22. <hi>Davids</hi> Servants wondred that he ſhould faſt and weep for his Child while it was alive: but when the Child was dead, he ſhould riſe up and eat bread, and be no more ſad. And <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>while the Child was yet alive I faſted and wept; for I ſaid, who can tell whether God will be gracious to me, that the Child may live; but now he is dead, wherefore ſhould I mourn? can I bring him back again? I ſhall go to him, but he ſhall not return to me.</hi> Now I ſee the will of God is accompliſht, why ſhould I grieve at it? <hi>I will hold my tongue, and not open my mouth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath done it, Pſal.</hi> 39.9.</p>

Why then after converſion, ſhould you weep for worldly things, when you enjoy ſpirituall mercies. Conſider, before conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I was content with outward worldly comforts, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was troubled for want of grace and hopes of Heaven, and want of reconciliation with God, I did never grieve for theſe; and ſeeing when I was without Chriſt, I did not grieve for the want of him, now when I have Chriſt, ſhall I grieve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I want the ordinary and common bleſſings of worldly things? A Chriſtian with a holy indignation ſhould take a revenge upon himſelf; if before my converſion, I could not grieve for the want of grace, now I have grace, I will not grieve for the want of outward comforts, ſeeing there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more reaſon you ſhould grieve for want of ſpirituall then temporall mercies.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To keep out worldly ſorrow, conſider, that God never laies any outward croſſe or affliction upon his people; but it is for ſin, either for the puniſhment of ſin, or the preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or purging of it out.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:115133:178"/>1. For the puniſhment of thy ſins; and if it be for the puniſhment of thy ſin, then, if thou mourn for any thing, mourn for thy ſins that was the cauſe, rather then for afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is but the effect of thy ſin; <hi>accept the puniſhment of thine iniquity, Levit.</hi> 26. with ſubmiſſion; but look upon the ſin with deteſtation: we have no reaſon to complain of our afflictions, <hi>Lamen:</hi> 3.39. <hi>why doth the living man complain, man for the puniſhment of his ſin?</hi> you ſhould in this caſe rather grieve for your ſins, then for your puniſhments.</p>
                  <p n="2">And 2dly, If it be not for the puniſhment, then it is for the prevention of ſin, to keep thee from ſin, and this was the end why God puniſhed <hi>Job,</hi> 33 <hi>Job</hi> 17. it was, <hi>that he might drive man from his purpoſe, and hide pride from him.</hi> And therefore ſuppoſe God takes away an Eſtate, or friends, or any outward comfort from you, as long as it is to prevent a ſin, to preſerve you from Hell and damnation, you have no cauſe of grief. If a Doctor takes away your blood from you, to prevent a pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie, will you be angry with him? ſurely no; ſo God never takes away any outward comfort from his people, but it is in mercy that he may prevent ſin thereby.</p>
                  <p n="3">Or 3dly, If not for the puniſhment or prevention of ſin, then it is for the purging out of ſin, as in <hi>Eſay</hi> 27.9. <hi>by this therefore ſhall the iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be purged, and this is all the fruit of it to take away his ſin.</hi> A man will not be grieved, that Phyſick makes him ſick, and pains him in his bowels, becauſe it purgeth out noxious and hurtfull humours. Beloved, your croſſes are but purging pills to purge out your corruptions. All worldly afflictions are either for the puniſhment, preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or purging out of ſin, and therefore we have cauſe to bear them patiently.</p>

Conſider, that God turns all worldly croſſes and loſſes into ſpirituall advantages to his people, thou ſhalt never be a loſer by thy afflictions. As when a poor man that is in debt, and in very much want of money, ſhall come to a rich man, and make known his condition to him, and beg relief from him; the man goes preſently to his Cheſt, and fetches a bag of money, and throwes it at him, the poor man would not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115133:179"/>look upon this as any wrong or injury done to him, but would rather be thankfull for it. So God turns all our ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing croſſes and afflictions into reall and ſpirituall advantages to us. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19. <hi>I know</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul, that this ſhall turn to my ſalvation. All things ſhall work together for good to them that love God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8 28.</note> Though we cannot ſee how it ſhould come to paſſe, but are in this caſe, like unto little Children, who when they ſee a heap of beautifull and ſweet Roſes lying upon a Table, and their Mother goes and puts them in a morter, and pounds them all to peeces, the Child cries and thinks the Mother ſpoyls them, though ſhe does it to make a conſerve of them, that they may be more uſefull and durable. So we think we have comforts like beds of Roſes, and when the Lord takes them from us, and breaks them all to pieces, we are apt to conceive they are all ſpoiled and deſtroyed, and we undone by it, whereas God intends it to work for our greater benefit and advantage.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Conſid. </seg>7</label> 7. Live in the meditation and contemplation of the joyes and glory of Heaven. And this will be a great means to keep out worldly ſorrow, the glory and happineſs of Heaven will ſo tranſport a Chriſtians ſoul with ſpirituall joy, that he will not eaſily be over-whelmed with worldly ſorrow. I have read one of the Schoolmen that was of this opinion, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency was not ſenſible of his naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, was becauſe he was ſo taken up with immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and communion with God. So now, if you were more taken up with converſing with God, and apprehenſions of glory, though you had nothing here below, yet you would think you wanted nothing. The conſideration of Heaven, and glory, and happineſs, would make you over-look all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly croſſes and afflictions: it is ſaid of <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>he was rapt up into the third Heaven, and ſaw things ineffable; but whether in the body or out of the body, he could not tell:</hi> that is, he ſaw ſo much glory, and was ſo taken up with the joyes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that he could not tell whether he was in the body or no, it made him to forget all his troubles and miſeries here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. I remember I have read in <hi>Jerome,</hi> what advice he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115133:179"/>he gives a young man in his time that was overmuch preſſed with ſorrow and grief for worldly croſſes. Saies he, do but now and then take a turn or two in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and then you will never think of a wilderneſs, or be troubled at the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of a deſert. Oh beloved, that your ſouls had once this art of divine ſpeculation, and contemplation, that you might have an experimentall knowledge of the joyes of Heaven, and this would keep you from mourning any more for worldly croſſes. When Chriſt was transfigured upon the Mount, ſaies <hi>Peter</hi> to him, <hi>Maſter, Maſter, it is good for us to be here, let us build three Tabernacles, one for thee, one for Moſes, and one for Elias, he</hi> was ſo lifted up, with the ſight of Heaven, that he never thought that he was then upon a barren Mountain, and of what wants and exigencies they ſhould be driven to there. I have formerly told you what I have read of the Eagle, that ſhe is like no other Bird that flies in the Aire; for whereas all other Birds when they are hurt, or want meat to ſatisfie their hunger, will crie and mourn, and make a noyſe: the Eagle, when it is hurt, will fly aloft, and comfort her ſelf with the warm beams of the Sun. And oh Beloved, if you would Eagle-lik ſore aloft in divine meditations, and contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of heavenly glory and happineſs: this would arm you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt worldly ſorrow very much.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Remember that your ſins call for more teares from you, then you are able to ſhed; and therefore do not waſt them about worldly things. Beloved, could you diſſolve into tears for your ſins, it would all be too little to expreſs your grief and ſorrow for them; nay, were every drop of tears you ſhed, an Ocean, it would be too little to ſhed for ſin. Tears are ſweet water, and it is pitty to waſh foul Rooms with them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them for your ſins, they have more need of them; and if you had more tears, all would be too little: nay, were your head a Fountain, and your eyes Rivers of tears, they would all be too little to ſhed, for thoſe many ſins and iniquities that you have committed againſt God.</p>

It is not like a Weeding-hook, to pluck up your joy by the roots; but like a Pruning-hook, to lop off the luxuriancy of it, and to keep your joy in its due decorum. This I lay down to take away thoſe prejudices that many men harbour againſt Religion, as if it made men melancholy, being apt to think, that when once they begin to be Religious, that then they muſt forſake and abandon all worldly comforts, and for ever ſhake hands with all the pleaſures of this life. Beloved, Religion doth not annihilate, but regulate your joyes: nay, being Religions, does rather increaſe then any way diminiſh your joyes, when God made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he promiſed him a Son, and God gave him the name, ſaying, <hi>thou ſhalt call his name Iſaac,</hi> which ſignifies laughter. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.19. to ſhew, that after thou art in Covenant with God, thou mayſt have joy and pleaſure; and therefore do not harbour ſuch ill thoughts of Religion, as to imagine you muſt ſhake hands with joy, when you cloſe with Religion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take this concluſion, that the worldly joy of a wicked 
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115133:181"/>man is oftentimes mingled with more inward gripes, &amp; grief of ſpirit, then the worldly joy of a godly man is; As in <hi>Prov.</hi> 13,14. <hi>In the midſt of laughter the heart is ſorrowfull.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. the Apoſtle there ſpeaks of ſome that did <hi>glory in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but not in heart.</hi> The joy of the wicked is but in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but not in reality. When they are in their greateſt jolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and mirth, even then they have ſome inward gripes and anguiſh of conſcience that galls &amp; troubles them: a man may have a neat ſhooe on his foot, yet no man knows where it pincheth, but he that wears it. A wicked mans joy, is like a godly mans ſorrow: the formers joy is but in appearance, not in truth; and a godly man hath ſomething like ſorrow; but it is not ſo indeed, they are but <hi>as ſorrowing, yet alwayes rejoycing,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. <hi>The bleſſing of the Lord maketh rich, and he addeth no ſorrow with it, Prov.</hi> 10.22.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. You are not to rejoyce at all for the puniſhment of ſin, in the unreaſonable Creatures. And upon this ground, the ſame Authour condemns the uſe of Bull or Bear-baiting, or Cock-fighting, becauſe it is a rejoycing in that which is the product of ſin; for it was ſin that firſt put an enmity between the Bear and the Dog, and between Creature and Creature, ſin was the cauſe of all diſcords and antipathies between Creatures, and therefore it is not allowable for us to rejoyce in that which is the effect of our own ſin. Indeed, for Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baiting

So likewiſe hawking and hunting, are allowable, becauſe thoſe Creatures cannot be taken without it. But all you that delight in Stage-playes, and make other mens ſin the matter of your joy.

Another we have in <hi>Luke</hi> 24.39. This was ſpoken here after Chriſts Reſurrection from the dead. When Chriſt came and ſtood in the middſt of his Diſciples (where they were together) and ſhewed them his hands and his feet which were pierced, that they might believe it was he, and that he was riſen from the dead, it is ſaid, <hi>they believed not for joy.</hi> This was a ſpirituall joy, when Chriſt had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered death, and hell, and the grave, and was riſen again from the dead, they rejoyced ſo much, that they could not believe it, one grace hindered and interrupted another; and therefore their joy was exceſſive. I ſpeak this only in reference to young Converts, they may have much ſin mingled with their joy.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have done with theſe eight Concluſions, I ſhall now proceed to the diſpatching of the Queries which will be more uſefull, in the proſecution of this Doctrine, <hi>That Chriſtians muſt not only take heed of being exceſſive in their ſorrow for worldly croſſes; but alſo of being exceſſive in their joy for worldly comforts.</hi>

When one grace juſtles out another, when worldly joy thruſts out ſorrow for ſin, then it is inordinate. Thus it was with <hi>Belſhazzer,</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.2. He ſpent his dayes in mirth and jollity, quaft and carouſed in the Veſſels of the Temple, in one day he feaſted a thouſand of his Lords, and was merry through wine; but what was the iſſue of all, you may ſee in the 20. verſe, <hi>his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardned in pride:</hi> his joy was exceſſive, becauſe it hardned his heart, and hindred and interrupted him from mourning for ſin. Thus <hi>Saul</hi> called for Muſick, when he ſhould have given himſelf to ſorrow for ſin. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. Why now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115133:185"/>look into your own boſoms, though God allowes you to rejoyce moderately in his mercies, yet if you be ſo taken up with joyes and pleaſures, that you are averſe from ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſerious thoughts of heart, in remembrance of your ſins, then your joy is exceſſive.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Your rejoycing in worldly comforts is then exceſſive, when it deprives and robs you of that fellow-feeling and compaſſionate affections which you ſhould have toward the ſorrows and afflictions of Gods Church and people. This you have laid down as a mark of exceſſiveneſs of joy, in <hi>Amos</hi> 6.4,5,6. <hi>They lie upon beds of Ivory, and ſtretch themſelves upon their couches, and eat the Lambs out of the flock, and the Calves out of the midſt of the ſtall, that chant to the ſound of the violl, and invent to themſelves inſtruments of Muſick, that drink wine in Bowles, and annoint themſelves with chiefe ointments, but they are not grieved for the afflictions of Joſeph. Iſrael</hi> here was wanton, and ſpent their time in pleaſures and jollity; but they were not grieved for the afflictions of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> what is that? why, by the afflictions of <hi>Joſeph</hi> are to be underſtood, the miſeries of the Tribe of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> becauſe that Tribe came from <hi>Joſeph:</hi> as the 10. Tribes were called <hi>Ephraim,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the firſt King of the 10. Tribes, came of the poſterity of <hi>Ephraim:</hi> and that one Tribe enduring great afflictions, as we may read, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.7. under King <hi>Joaſh,</hi> the nine Tribes were not mourning for them, that was their ſin; and therein their joy was exceſſive. Now beloved, all you whoſe hearts do ſuggeſt this to you, that you live merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the world, and ſo ſpend your time in mirth and jolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it quite eats out all compaſſion and fellow-feeling in you, towards the miſeries and afflictions of the Church of God; that let Religion and the cauſe of God, ſink or ſwim, and let the people of God ſtand or fall, it ſhall never trouble you, in this caſe your joy is exceſſive.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When your worldly joy doth damp and dull your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in God, and in ſpirituall duties, then is your joy exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, when thy delight and reliſh in the Creature is as ſweet as hony; but yet canſt take no more joy in communion with
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115133:185"/>God, in performing duties to him, and receiving grace and ſpirituall mercies from him, then there is taſt in the white of an Egge: this is a ſign thy joy is exceſſive: as in <hi>Job</hi> 21.11,12.13,14,15. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks there of the wicked, that <hi>they ſend forth their little ones like a flock, and their Children dance, they take the Timbrel and Harp, and rejoyce at the ſound of the Organ, they ſpend their dayes in mirth, and in a moment go down into the grave:</hi> here are jolly men indeed, they ſpend their dayes mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; but what is the iſſue of all this? <hi>therefore they ſay unto God, depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes, what is the Almighty that we ſhould ſerve him? and what profit ſhould we have, if we pray unto him?</hi> Here you ſee their joy was exceſſive and immoderate, becauſe it did damp their love &amp; duty to God. All recreation ſhould be as a whetſtone to ſharpen us to duty, as Phyſick to ſharpen the ſtomack to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh food, not to dog and dull our appetite to ſpiritual things.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Your joy was exceſſive in that worldly comfort which you grieve too much in the loſſe and want of. A man never grieves too much in the want of any mercy; but he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce too much before in the enjoyment of it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Then your joy is exceſſive in outward comforts, when it makes you inſult and triumph over the miſeries and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other men, that want thoſe comforts that you enjoy. <hi>Judges</hi> 16.23.25. <hi>Sampſon</hi> (you know) when he diſcovered wherein his great ſtrength lay, the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> cut off his hair, and then his ſtrength was gone, and he became as another man, and the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> took him and put out his eyes, and bound him in fetters of braſſe, and made him grind in the priſon-houſe, they made him their drudge and their ſlave, <hi>and the Lords of the Philiſtins gathered themſelves together to offer ſacrifice to</hi> Dagon, <hi>and to rejoyce, and when their hearts were merry, they called for</hi> Sampſon <hi>to make them ſport:</hi> their immoderate joy did make them inſult over this poor blind man in miſery. Beloved, then is your joy exceſſive, when you make the afflictions of other men to be matter of your Joy.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Your Joy is exceſſive when it is mingled with luxury 
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115133:186"/>and ſenſuality. <note place="margin">2 Sam. 13.28. Luke 15.23,14.</note> Hence it is that you read ſo often in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of mens being <hi>merry with wine,</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.36. and as an Authour obſerves, the ſame word in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> that ſignifies to be merry, ſignifies to be drunk, in the 43. <hi>Gen.</hi> laſt; when mirth proceeds ſo far as to drunkenneſs and ſenſuality, <note place="margin">E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="7">7. When worldly joy breeds ſecurity and inſenſibleneſs of Gods judgements approaching any place, then it is inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Thus <hi>Ethiopia</hi> was called <hi>the rejoycing City that dwelt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, Zeph</hi> 2.16. and hence it is, that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. fear is adjoyned to rejoycing; <hi>ſerve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling.</hi> And hence it is, that <hi>Abſolom</hi> when he would by treachery ſhed the blood of <hi>Amnon,</hi> gave this Counſel to his Servants, <hi>When you ſee Amnon merry, then fall upon him,</hi> as knowing that when his heart was merry, he would then be ſecure. And ſo thoſe in <hi>Amos</hi> 6.3.6. <hi>that chant to the ſound of the Violl, and drink wine in Bowles,</hi> are ſaid to be men that <hi>put far away the evill day,</hi> and were ſecure in their pleaſures, and ſo theſe in <hi>Eſay</hi> 22.12.13. <hi>In the day that the Lord called for weeping and mourning, and baldneſs, and to girding with Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, behold joy and gladneſs, ſlaying Oxen, and killing ſheep, eating fleſh and drinking wine, let us eat and drink, for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row we ſhall die:</hi> they would not believe the prophet that foretold them the Judgements of God that were coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; but in ſcoffing and jearing manner, ſaid one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, <hi>let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall die.</hi> And ſo again in <hi>Eſay</hi> 56.12. <hi>Come ye, ſay they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill our ſelves with ſtrong drink, and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant,</hi> they feared not want nor alteration of their condition; which ſecurity of theirs, declared their joy to be exceſſive and inordinate.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. When men will run to worldly joyes and pleaſures, to ſtill and ſtifle the troubles and terrours of their conſciences.</p>
                  <p>When a man ſhall have a conviction upon his conſcience, which troubles and perplexes him for ſome groſſe evill he hath committed in his life, and ſhall then run to his recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and pleaſures, or get amongſt jolly Company, to caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115133:186"/>and ſhake off theſe troubles that are upon him: this ſhews his joy is immoderate. And thus <hi>Saul</hi> did diſcover a joviall and ſenſuall ſpirit, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.15. <hi>when an evill ſpirit from the Lord troubled him,</hi> that is, when he had ſome guilt and terrour lying upon his Conſcience, then he commanded his Servants <hi>to ſeek him out a man skilfull in Muſick to play be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him;</hi> but he had been better to have gone to prayer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his knees, then to call for Muſick, and run to ſenſuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to remove his trouble. And thus it was with thoſe Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, that ſacrificed their Children unto <hi>Moloch,</hi> they had Inſtruments of Muſick, but what to do? why firſt it was to drown the cries of their Children, and ſecondly, to provoke them to merriment and jollity, that their Conſciences might not trouble them for ſo cruel a murther as the ſacrificing their Children. Why (now beloved) you that can when a Sermon hath come home to you, and toucht you to the quick, and the word of God hath come with power, and wrought effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually upon you, to the diſcovering and convincing you of your ſin. If you then run to your recreations and pleaſures, to company-keeping and Stage-playes, or the like, to divert your thoughts from your ſins, and remove the terrour and trouble of your conſcience. This is a ſign your joy is exceſſive and ſinfull; indeed this is the way rather to increaſe then to quiet the checks of conſcience. The <hi>Pellican</hi> to put out the fire, flaps it with her wings, and ſo inſtead of putting it out, kindles it the more, &amp; burns her ſelf; ſo do thoſe that ſeek by worldly pleaſure and jollity, to ſtifle the checks of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And thus I have very briefly run over theſe 8. particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, to ſhew you wherein a mans worldly joy for outward comforts is exceſſive.</p>
                  <p>I have only now a ſecond thing to run over, and then give you a ſhort uſe, and ſo have done.</p>

Thou haſt thy election, vocation, redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, glorification, thou haſt all theſe objects to provoke thy Joy, and to faſten thy delight upon.

There is a great deal vaſter difference between the things of Heaven, the mercies of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and theſe outward comforts here below, then there is between Braſſe and Gold, between Pibbles, &amp; Pearls, between the Sun and a Candle. Therefore Conſider, I have a God and Chriſt, Heaven and happineſs, pardon, reconciliation, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, Juſtification, redemption, and glorification. I have all theſe to fix and place my Joy upon, and therefore why ſhould I rejoyce ſo much in the things of this world. The Diſciples of Chriſt thought themſelves ſome body, and were puffed up becauſe they could caſt out Devills, and work mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; but ſaies Chriſt to them, <hi>rejoyce not in that the Devills are ſubject to you; but rejoyce that your names are written in Heaven,</hi> Luke 10.20. the more any is taken with the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and contemplation of the Joyes of Heaven, the leſſe he will be in the valuation and admiration of comforts here on earth. The higher you ſtand, the leſſe you ſee things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: will any rejoyce in the light of a Candle, when he ſees the brightneſs of the Sun ſhining in its full ſtrength. It is a Rule amongſt Divines, that as Phyſicians when a man bleeds at noſe, to ſtop and make a diverſion of the blood, will open a vein: ſo the way to keep your worldly Joy from being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive, is ſeriouſly to ponder and conſider what great cauſe you have of ſpirituall Joy and reioycing, and this will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert

To turn all the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the right objects, is the way to keep them from being exceſſively bent upon the wrong; fear God, and you will not fear men, love Chriſt and you will not over-love the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, weep for ſins and corruption, and you will not mourn too much for outward croſſes, rejoyce in ſpirituall things, and you will not joy over-much in temporalls.</p>

As firſt, from the conſideration of the ſcope that the Apoſtle aims at in bringing in of this expreſſion, <hi>they that buy as if they 
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115133:189"/>poſſeſſed not:</hi> the Apoſtle had all along before, in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpoken of Marriage, and the duty of people in that eſtate: and here he treats of trading, of buying and ſelling; from whence I note.</p>
                  <p n="1">

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the variety of the matter, the Apoſtle here handles, whether men are in an afflicted and ſorrowfull, or in a proſperous and joyfull condition, whether they buy or ſell, or what ever their condition be, here is matter of advice for them; from whence I note, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> 
                     <hi>That the Scripture is large, and reaches to the ſeverall and various Callings and conditions of men in the world.</hi> There is not any Calling, condition, kind or ſex of people in the world, but there are either generall or particular directions that the word of God affords them, and therefore well might the Pſalmiſt ſay, <hi>Thy Commandements are exceeding broad, Pſal.</hi> 119.96.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the tearm the Apoſtle here uſeth, <hi>they that buy:</hi> now buying you know is a giving a valuable ſumme of mony for a Commodity, which the ſeller hath profit, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by; hence I may note, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> 
                     <hi>that the Apoſtle was againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of community, or having all things common amongſt men:</hi> the very mention of buying and ſelling, intimates, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes a propriety in what a man hath. <hi>A man hath a proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his Eſtate, or whatſoever he hath lawfully gotten;</hi> and therefore the Doctrine of Court paraſites who ſcrue up Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy ſo high, as if the King may by power and force, take away all that a Subject hath, is falſe and erroneous. This is tyranny, and not Soveraignty. And hence it was, that <hi>Ahab</hi> though he were a covetous King, yet he would not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard by force and violence, but would buy it of him: this therefore makes againſt a community, for buying and ſelling argues a propriety in the ſeller of what he hath.</p>

                  <p>I do not intend to inſiſt particularly upon any of theſe points, but ſhall draw out two generall Doctrines from the whole bulk and body of the Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They that buy,</hi> the Apoſtle does not only preſcribe Rules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Marriage, and to men in a conjugall eſtate; but likewiſe about buying and ſelling, and negotiating in the world: from whence obſerve,</p>

                     <hi>That Chriſtians ought to carry ſuch weaned affections, to what they have gotten by buying and ſelling, as if they poſseſſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall be but brief in this latter point, but ſhall expatiate, &amp; be more large in the former, <hi>That Chriſtians ſhould take heed that they do not tranſgreſs Scripture Rules in their buying and ſelling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now beloved, will you follow me a little, and lend me your attentions in the handling of this point. I ſhall this morning lay you down ſome Scripture Rules which are to be obſerved in buying; and in the afternoon, ſhall give you ſome Scripture Rules, which you are to take heed that you do not tranſgreſs in ſelling. <note place="margin">Severall Scripture Rules and Cautions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſhall ſpend this hour in giving you ten particular Scripture Rules, which you are to take heed that you do not tranſgreſs in your buying. As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If you would not tranſgreſs Scripture Rules in buying, then take heed that you do not diſcommend thoſe commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, 
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115133:190"/>that you are about to buy, thereby to bring down the price of the Commodity, and ſo to get it cheaper, and for leſſe then it is worth. There is a known place for this in <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.14. <hi>It is naught, it is naught,</hi> (ſaith the buyer) <hi>but when he is gone his way, then he boaſteth.</hi> In <hi>Solomons</hi> time, men were ſo wicked, that when they came to Market to buy any thing, the buyer would ſay, it is naught, it is naught, though the Commodity were very good and vendible, and the price de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the ſeller, reaſonable; <hi>but when he is gone then he boaſts,</hi> that is, he boaſts of what a good penyworth he had, and what a good Bargain he had made, or the like: this then is the firſt caution, in buying a Commodity, do not diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it, thereby to have it cheaper, when it is good and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Do not make Vowes and Proteſtations that you will give no more for a Commodity then what you have firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, when afterwards you muſt, and do give more. This is a common practice among men, to come to a Shop, and bid money for a Commodity, and the buyer to ſay, I will not give a peny more, and the ſeller not to take a farthing leſſe; and yet both the buyer gives more, and the ſeller takes leſſe, then what the one firſt bid, and the other firſt profered it for. This though frequently practiſed, yet cannot be juſtified. It is a very palpable lie, and a great ſin, and therefore take heed of it, if once thy promiſe be paſt, thou art bound up, thou ſinneſt if thou give a peny more.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Do not give counterfeit money for thoſe Commodities you buy. It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whoſe juſt dealing and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are recorded to be an example and pattern to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Generations, when he was to buy the field of <hi>Mach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelah</hi> of <hi>Ephron,</hi> the Son of <hi>Zohar</hi> the <hi>Hittite, Gen.</hi> 23.16. the Text ſaies, <hi>he gave him for it</hi> 400 <hi>ſhekells of ſilver, currant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with the Merchant;</hi> and therefore (beloved) you tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs Scripture Rules, in buying Commodities, if you give braſſe money for ſilver, or counterfeit God for right, when you know it to be ſo: it is no better then meer cozenage. I mention this, becauſe there is a world of deceit now amongſt 
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115133:191"/>us, in paying baſe and counterfeit money.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Obſerve this Rule, do not give for a Commodity leſſe then in your Conſcience you think it is worth, it is an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in buying, when you ſeek to bring a Commodity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its due value: you ought to give for it, as much as in conſcience you think it is worth. <note place="margin">Gen. 23 9.</note> And thus did <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he was to buy the Cave of <hi>Machpelah</hi> of <hi>Ephron,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>I will give thee the worth of it in money:</hi> and ſo <hi>David</hi> when he was to buy the threſhing floore of <hi>Ornan</hi> the <hi>Jebuſite,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>give me the floore, and I will give thee the full valne of it,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.22.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Do not long defer the time of paying for thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities you buy upon truſt, when thou haſt wherewith to pay it. This Rule you have in <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.27.28. <hi>withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it: ſay not to thy Neighbour, go and come again, and to morrow I will give thee, when thou haſt it by thee:</hi> this is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here in reference to buying and ſelling. When a man hath ſold a Commodity, and is forc'd to go again and again for his money, and yet cannot get it. That this is the meaning of the phraſe, appears by theſe words, <hi>withhold not good from them to whom it is due:</hi> though this Text be referred to works of mercy, yet it hath relation likewiſe to Trading in the World, or buying of Commodities. If you owe a man mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for a Commodity you have bought of him, you ought to pay what you owe, and not let the Creditor come day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter day for his money, and yet go without it, when thou haſt it by thee. This makes againſt Banckrupts that borrow mony take up goods, and make no conſcience of paying what they owe for them: if men had but any ſparks of ingenuity and good nature in them, they could never be joviall and jolly in the World, when they have not paid every man his own. <hi>Phocion</hi> vvould not feaſt till he had paid <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>llicles</hi> vvhat he owed him. <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet vvas ſo conſciencious in this particular, that vvhen he made the poor Widovvs oyle to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in the 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.7. he bid her ſell it, and firſt pay her debts, and then live ſhe and her Children upon the reſt,. It is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115133:191"/>laid dovvn as a badge of a vvicked man in Scripture, not to pay vvhat a man ovveth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.21. <hi>the wicked borroweth and payeth not again.</hi> To borrovv money, or to buy a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, is all one; it is the Character of a vvicked man to ovve money, and not to pay it.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>6</label> 6. Do not engroſſe a Commodity, my meaning is, do not buy all of a Commodity into your ovvn hands alone, that none ſhall have any beſide thee, that by that means you may ſell it at your ovvn rate: this is a great oppreſſion, deſtructive to a Common-vvealth, and all Trading therein. You ſhall find the Scripture condemns this in <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.26. it is ſpoken in reference to Corn-mongers, thoſe that had money enough to buy great quantities of it. Saies the Text, <hi>he that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth Corne, the People ſhall curſe him; but bleſſing ſhall be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of him that ſelleth it.</hi> There vvere at that time Corn-mongers, that vvhen Corn vvas cheap, vvould buy up all they could get, and keep it till it grevv dear again, they vvould vvithhold their corn till it vvas dear, and then ſell it. Now ſaies <hi>Solomon,</hi> he that does thus, <hi>the People ſhall curſe him, but he that ſelleth it the people ſhall bleſs him,</hi> ſo that it is no ſin in its ſelf to engroſſe a Commodity, if you ſell it cheap and at the ordinary rate, this is no ſin; but for a man to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſe a Commodity, meerly to advance and enhance the price of it, this is ſuch an oppreſſion, that the people ſhall curſe the man that does it. Men in this caſe of ingroſſing, may be very well compared to the great Oak, which does ſo ſpread and dilate its branches, that no little Tree can thrive under it. So do many men ſo much engroſſe Commodities, that poorer men cannot live by them, which is a groſſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and a great wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If you would not tranſgreſs Scripture Rules, do not in buying a Commodity, take any advantage of the miſtake or over-fight of the ſeller. As ſuppoſe you ſhould come to a Shop, and there buy ſo many yards of Cloth, and the Shop-keeper ſhould either give you more Cloth then is your due, or take leſſe mony of thee then is his due; you muſt take no advantage againſt him in this particular; for if you take any 
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115133:192"/>thing more of him then you have bought, it is theft, or if you give him any thing leſſe then you bargain for, it is theft. And this you have in <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.12. <hi>Jacob</hi> when there was a Famine in the Land, he ſent his Sonnes into <hi>Egypt</hi> to buy Corn; when they came there, <hi>Joſeph</hi> knowing his Brethren, what does he do but put the money they brought for their Corn into the mouth of their Sacks again, and ſent them home; where when they found their money in their Sacks, they told their Father of it, who bid them go back again, and carry him the money they brought away in their Sacks mouth; for ſaith he, <hi>peradventure it was an over-ſight.</hi> Here was conſcienciouſneſs, when a man ſhall either give thee more then is thy due, or thou give him leſſe then is his due: in neither of theſe caſes muſt you take advantage againſt him; for if you do, the Lord looks upon it as no better then cozenage and deceit.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In buying Commodities, do not merchandize upon the Lords day. It is true, in caſe of urgent neceſſities, as for the maintenance of life, either in man or beaſt it is lawfull; but for buying of thoſe things of which there is no neceſſity, and you may well be without them till <hi>Munday:</hi> in this caſe you ſin, if you buy any thing on the Lords day, that's Market day for Heaven, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> entred into an Oath, and the people with him, <hi>that if any of the people of the Land bring Ware, or any Victualls on the Sabbath-day to ſell, that they would not buy it of them on the Sabbath-day.</hi> Now though ſome may be ready to object, and ſay, that this was the Jewiſh Sabbath here ſpoken of, wherein they were ſo ſtrict; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it is true, it was; but yet neither does the Goſpel give you leave to profane the Chriſtian Sabbath, but ought now to be kept as ſtrictly as it was then. And therefore beloved, I cannot ſee but it is a ſin for men to buy either wine, or pepper, or muſtard, or any other ſuch like trifle, that they may well be without, it muſt needs be unlawfull and ſinfull, to buy any thing that you may well be without, in that caſe you ſin, if you buy upon the Lords day; and therefore let me intreat you, rather to want ſuch triviall things, then to tranſgreſs Scripture Rules, in buying of them upon this day.</p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:115133:192"/>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>9</label> 9. Do not in buying of a Commodity, work upon the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of a poor man that hath need of money, to make him ſell it at ſuch low tearms, as he cannot live by it, this is a very great ſin and oppreſſion. Many times rich men do work upon the neceſſities of the poor; for they muſt ſell of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, it may be to buy bread, or more materialls to ſet themſelves at work upon: now they will not buy their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, unleſs they may have it cheaper then they can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford it; this is a great oppreſſion: therefore in <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.14. it is ſaid, <hi>if thou ſelleſt ought to thy Neighbour, or buyeſt ought of thy Neighbour, ye ſhall not oppreſs one another.</hi> There is an oppreſſion in buying, as well as in ſelling, when a man does work upon the poverty of a poor man, and will make him ſell cheaper then he can afford it, or elſe will not buy of him at all. O beloved, how few are there in the world, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious in their buying in theſe regards.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. If you would not tranſgreſs Scripture Rules in baying, then take heed that ye do not buy thoſe things that are not fit and allowable to be bought and ſold: as firſt, do not buy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things, as the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, Church-livings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for theſe are not things to be bought. This is call'd <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> Act. 8.20. When <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would have bought the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>thy mony periſh with thee,</hi> ſaid Peter, <hi>becauſe thou haſt thought that the gift of God may be purchaſed with money.</hi> 2. Do not buy ſtolen goods, they are not meet to be bought. If thou knoweſt that the goods which are to be ſold, are ſtolen goods, they are not to be bought; but rather to be reſtored. <hi>I</hi> am afraid that this is a ſin, that many men do not make conſcience of in this City: as we uſe to ſay, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver is as bad as the Thief: ſo let me tell you, the buyer is as bad as the Thief likewiſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Do not buy Monuments nor reliques of Idolatry, as Croſſes, Beads, Crucifixes, Images, and the like, theſe ought not to be bought.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Do not buy men for ſlaves: this is that which is reproved <hi>Amos</hi> 8.6. <hi>That we may buy the poor for ſilver, and the needy for a pair of ſhooes.</hi> So in <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.7. <hi>If a man be found ſtealing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115133:193"/>of any of his Brethren of the Children of Iſrael, and maketh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of him, or ſelleth him, then that thief ſhall die:</hi> thou muſt not ſteal a man and ſell him.</p>
                  <p>And thus you ſee <hi>I</hi> have gone over very briefly theſe ten particulars. And oh beloved, let me tell you, the fear of my heart is, that there are few of you that keep within bounds in theſe particulars; but in one or other of them you have tranſgreſſed in your buyings.</p>
                  <p>

Rev. 3.18.</note> and therefore avoid ſuch courſes; and let me exhort you in buying Commodities, amongſt all your buyings in the world, let me intreat you to buy that which <hi>Solomon</hi> bids you buy, namely, to <hi>buy the truth and ſell it not,</hi> and that which Chriſt counſels you to buy, <hi>come buy of me gold that ye may be rich, and white Rayment that you may be cloathed;</hi> and buy that which the good Merchant ſold all that he had to purchaſe, <note place="margin">Mat. 13.44</note> namely, the Pearl in the field. So do you ſell all you have to buy this Pearl of great price the Lord Jeſus; but do not miſtake me, when <hi>I</hi> bid you buy ſpirituall things, do not think, they are to be purchaſed with money; but <hi>I</hi> would have you labour and endeavour after them, <hi>Eſay</hi> 5.1. <hi>Ho eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money: come ye, buy and eat, yea come buy wine and milk, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money, and without price:</hi> theſe are not to be bought with money, but by labours and endeavours, and earneſt prayers unto God for them: you muſt give the rags of your ſin and corruption, for this white raiment of Chriſts righteouſneſs. Oh let not the Market-dayes of your ſoules ſlip over without buying ſomething for your ſoules good, buy the truth and ſel it not, buy the Pearl of grace, look after ſpirituall things, do not think the things of the world to be worth ſo much, and grace and Chriſt, Heaven and happineſs, and glory, worth nothing. There is nothing here below but we may give too
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115133:193"/>much for, we may buy gold too dear; but we can never buy Chriſt and grace too dear, we can never give too much for them; one houres enjoyment of Chriſt, will infinitely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence all the troubles, and miſeries, and loſſes we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe for him here, and therefore beloved, do not ſpend ſo much time, and take ſo much pains for theſe tranſitory things here below: theſe complementall and circumſtantiall peeces of felicity, and ſpend ſo little time, and take ſo little pains af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe perfections, and eſſentiall points of happineſs, the getting an intereſt in Chriſt, in his righteouſneſs, merits, and ſatisfaction. <hi>Diogenes</hi> taxed the folly of men in his time, <hi>quod res praetioſas minimo emerent, venderentque viliſſimas plurimo:</hi> they valued the moſt precious things little; and the moſt vile at a great rate. Woe to thoſe that ſtop Religions Trade, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.52. <hi>That take away the key of knowledg, neither entring in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor ſuffering thoſe that would.</hi>

                  <p>I Come now to the other particular, that you take heed you do not tranſgreſs Scripture Rules in ſelling Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. And as the Scripture is very large in laying down Rules concerning buying: ſo likewiſe it is not wanting in laying down Rules and directions in reference to the ſelling of Commodities, I ſhall name to you 9. or 10. of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If you would not tranſgreſs Scripture Rules, do not needleſly multiply words in ſelling a Commodity. <note place="margin">Scripture Rules concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</note> The Scripture is large in this particular. As <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.15. when <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was to buy the Cave of <hi>Machpelah</hi> of <hi>Ephron,</hi> there was but one word between them, <hi>Ephron</hi> ſaid it was worth ſo much, and <hi>Abraham</hi> preſently gave it him. ſo <hi>Zach.</hi> 11,12. <hi>If you think good,</hi> ſaies God, <hi>give me my price, and if not, forbear.</hi> Multiplicity of words is needleſs. <note place="margin">Prov. 10.19.</note> 
                     <hi>In a multitude of words,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, there is ſin.</hi> As in ordinary diſcourſe, ſo in commerce in a multitude of words is ſin. I do not ſpeak this as if I would have men ſtupid and blockiſh in a ſhop; but they ſhould not be laviſh and frolick, and frothy in their ſpeeches.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Do not multiply words in commending and overpray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing your Commodity, when you know in your conſcience, that there is a flaw or a fault in it: this is a vicious carriage in a ſeller, when he uſes abundance of fine words to ſet off a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115133:194"/>bad Commodity. As it is a ſin in the buyer, to ſay it is naught, it is naught, ſo in the ſeller, to ſay it is good, it is good, when it is not ſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sell not your Commodities by falſe waights, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; do not keep a deceitfull ballance, or a deceitfull mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Amos</hi> 5. there the Lord reproves thoſe <hi>that ſet forth wheat, making the Ephah ſmall, and the ſhekell great, and falſifying the ballances by deceit;</hi> ſo in <hi>Prov.</hi> 10 20. <hi>divers waights and divers meaſures, both of them are a like abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Lord,</hi> that is, the Lord hates and abhorrs thoſe men that uſe, and ſell by thoſe waights and meaſures that are not good; and therefore the Lord gave a ſpeciall Law to all that did follow trading in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.15,16. that they ſhould uſe no deceit in their waights and meaſures, in the 13. and 14. verſes, <hi>Thou ſhalt not have in thy bag divers waights, a great &amp; a ſmall, thou ſhalt not have in thy houſe divers meaſures, a great &amp; a ſmall; but thou ſhalt have a perfect and a juſt waight, a perfect and a juſt meaſure ſhalt thou have, that thy days may be lengthned in the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee; for all that do ſuch things, and all that do unrighteouſly are an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto the Lord thy God,</hi> which is not to be underſtood of divers ſorts of waights, as pounds, ounces, ells, yards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or of many of the ſame ſort, if of the juſt ſize; but of divers waights of the ſame ſort of an unjuſt and unequall ſize. And therefore beloved, take heed of unjuſt and falſe waights or meaſures, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.10. ſaies God there, <hi>Are there yet the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wickedneſs in the houſe of the wicked?</hi> (mony that is gotten by unjuſt waights &amp; meaſures, are called the treaſures of wickedneſs) <hi>and the ſcant meaſure that is abominable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. You are to make conſcience, not only that you do not ſpeak falſly; but alſo that you do not ſpeak equivocally. It is an obſervatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that one hath upon theſe words, <hi>let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud his Brother,</hi> ſaies he; many Tradeſ-men, though they will not lie, yet they will equivocate. Many men to put off a Commodity, will have a partner, or ſome friend or other to bid them money for it, and then the next Cuſtomer they have forit, they will tell him that but even now ſuch a man 
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115133:195"/>offered ſo much for it, to draw the buyer to give ſo much; And then they will ſay it coſt me ſo much, when it may be, they had Commodities of a higher priſe, and greater value amongſt them at the ſame rate, and perhaps they have a great deal of time allowed them for the payment, whereas the buyer payes ready mony; and many ſuch like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocations to deceive the world withall.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Do not in ſelling a Commodity, work upon the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or ſimplicity of the man that comes to buy that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of thee. If you perceive that he is unskilfull, rather uſe him the better then the worſe, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.9. God threatneth <hi>to puniſh the young men that leap upon the threſhold, and fill their Maſters houſes with violence and deceit,</hi> and ſo in 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.6. ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>let no man go beyond, or defraud his Brother in any matter, for the Lord is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> avenger of all ſuch.</hi> So in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. the Apoſtle ſpeaking there of corrupt teachers, ſaies he, <hi>through covetouſneſs ſhall they with fained words make merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of you:</hi> thus do falſe Tradeſmen in their Shops. It is a great ſin for a man to work upon the ignorance of the buyer thereby to advance the price of a commodity.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Take heed you do not embaſe a commodity from its primitive and originall goodneſs and excellency, that ſo you may get the more by it. This the Scripture condemns in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> 8.6. <hi>They ſell the refuſe of the wheat.</hi> The Corn-mongers would pick out the beſt grains, &amp; then ſell the refuſe, which God reproves and condemns them for. And this the Prophet alludes to in <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.22. <hi>Thy ſilver is become droſſe, thy wine mixt with water,</hi> they mingled wine with water, and droſſe with filver; the Scripture condemns the debaſing a commodity from its primitive goodneſs, and yet to ſell it at the full price and value of the beſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Be not amongſt the firſt that ſhall raiſe the Market, and enhance the price of a commodity. This I hinted in the morning to be a very great miſcarriage. In <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.26. <hi>He that withholdeth Corn the people ſhall curſe hin; but be that ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it the people ſhall bleſs him.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Neh. 5.2.3</note> It is a great oppreſſion in a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> for men to raiſe the price of corn, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commodity, when there is no neceſſity of it.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:115133:195"/>8. Be not ſo eager and intent in ſelling your commodities, as not to content your ſelves to trade upon the ſix dayes of the week; but you muſt ſell upon the Sabbath-day too. Be not like thoſe in <hi>Amos</hi> 8.5. that ſay, <hi>when will the new Moons be gone, that we may ſell corn, and the Sabbath, that we may ſet forth wheat.</hi> Theſe greedy covetous muck-worms were ſo bent upon their gains, that the ſix dayes of the week were not enough for them, but they would ſell upon the Sabbath too. <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.21. this is that which <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was ſo carefull to reform, when the Merchants came into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to ſell their commodities on the Sabbath-day, he <hi>teſtified againſt them, and conteſted with the Nobles of Judah, and ſaid unto them, what evill thing is this that you do, and profane the Sabbath-day?</hi> and he told the Merchants and ſellers of all kind of wares, that if they did ſo again, he would lay hands upon them: ſo that from that time forth they cam no more on the Sabbath. This condemns your common tipling-houſes, and ſmall retail Trades, that make nothing of ſelling ſmall trifling things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this day, which is a great ſin.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. When your cozenage and unjuſt dealings in your ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are found out and diſcovered, do not juſtifie your ſelves in your deceit. Many men, if you come and tell them, that they ſell dearer then others, they will not be perſwaded to it, or if you tell them the commodity you bought of them, is not good, they will ſay it is as good as can be afforded of the price, like thoſe in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12.7. <hi>Ephraim is a Merchant, the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances of deceit are in his hand, he loveth to oppreſs, yet he ſaies, I am become rich, I have found me out ſubſtance, and in all my labours they ſhall find no iniquity in me; that were ſin.</hi> Though the ballances of deceit were in his hand, yet ſaies he, none can accuſe me of ſin or iniquity in my dealings.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Do not ſell thoſe Commodities that are not vendible, nor fit to be ſold. As firſt,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Spirituall things they are not to be ſold; <hi>Simon Magus</hi> when he would have purchaſed the gift of the Holy Ghoſt with money, ſaies the Apoſtle, go thy way, and <hi>thy money po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:115133:196"/>2. And ſo monuments of Idolatry, Crucifixes, Images, Beads, Conjuring Books, and the like: theſe are not fit to be ſold, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. <hi>Many of them that uſed curious arts, came and brought their Books and burnt them, and the price of them was valued to be</hi> 50000. <hi>peeces of ſilver.</hi> Theſe books here ſpoken of were Conjuring-books, and though they were of ſo great value, yet they would not ſell them, but burnt them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Do not ſell men for ſlaves, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.7. <hi>If a man be found ſtealing any of his Brethren, the Children of Iſrael, and maketh merchandize of him, or ſelleth him, then that thief ſhall die, and you ſhall put away evill from you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. (And again) you muſt not ſell your ſelf as <hi>Ahab</hi> did, to work wickedneſs, and thus witches ſell themſelves to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, to be his Servants; and thus do all licencious and looſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Remember beloved, <hi>you are not your own; but are bought with a price,</hi> even with the precious blood of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and therefore you muſt glorifie God in your ſoules and bodies that are his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. You muſt not ſell ſtollen goods, theſe are not ſaleable: as men ſhould not buy, ſo neither ſhould they ſell ſtollen goods.</p>
                  <p n="6">And 6. You muſt not ſell any thing that cannot be made uſe of, without ſin, as ſtuff to paint faces with, and ſuch like: It is true, a man may ſell thoſe things that accidentally may be ſinfull in the uſing of it; but we muſt not ſell ſuch things as are only for ſinfull uſes.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have done with theſe ten particulars, wherein you muſt not tranſgreſs Scripture Rules in ſelling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> ſhall now handle ſome caſes of conſcience touching tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and commerce in the world.</p>

                  <p>I anſwer, that though it is true, the Scripture is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, how much you ſhould get, whether a peny, or two pence, or 3. or 4. more or leſſe, in a ſhilling: yet your gains ought to be no more then what is ordinarily gotten in ſuch
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115133:196"/>Commodities, by men of your own Trade: as the Market goes, and as ordinarily things are valued in the place where you dwell, thoſe rates you ought to take.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sell as thoſe men do, that are moſt conſcientious in their wayes, as far as they go you may go.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Then I conceive it no breach of equity in trading, to take the more for a commodity if the man that buyes it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires time for the payment of it, then if he paid ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and my reaſon is this, becauſe the parting with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity without money, is a dammage and hinderance to the ſeller; and therefore he may lawfully take more, as in <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.14,15. ſaies God there, <hi>if thou buyeſt ought of thy Neighbour, 
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115133:197"/>or ſelleſt ought to thy Neighbour, you ſhall not oppreſs one another; but according to the multitude of years thou ſhalt increaſ the price thereof and according to the fewneſs of years, thou ſhalt diminiſh the price of it.</hi> The caſe here is the ſame, if you ſell your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity for a tearm of years, before you have your money, you may ſell it for the more, and if for ready money, you ought to take the leſſe for it. <hi>Ahab</hi> would not take away <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths</hi> Vineyard from him; <note place="margin">1 King. 21.2.</note> but ſaies he, <hi>if thou wilt let me have it, I will either give thee the worth of it in money, or elſe a better Vineyard for it.</hi> Mark here, if he had taken ready mony, he ſhould have had but the worth of it; but if he would not take mony, he was to have a better thing, a better Vineyard for it. So that I cannot ſee any thing in Scripture, whereby this is inconſiſtent with the Rules of equity; for a man to take a little more for a commodity then it is worth, becauſe he hath not money in hand for it. But yet you muſt not work upon a poor mans neceſſity in this caſe, and you muſt be ſure, never to take more then what your dammage amounts to by the forbearance of your money ſo long. </p>

                  <p n="1">1. <note place="margin">Affections to the world when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive.</note> You then place an exceſſive affection upon your Eſtate in the world, when your earneſt endeavours and purſuit after worldly wealth does take you off from all ſerious endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after ſpirituall things. And thus it was immoderate in thoſe Tradesmen mentioned in <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.5. that when <hi>a great King had invited them to a marriage feaſt, and ſent forth his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to tell thoſe that were bidden, that all things were ready and prepared for them, they made light of it, and went their wayes, one to his Farme, another to his Merchandize,</hi> and would not come: when men are ſo bent upon their gain, and have their hearts ſo taken up with the world, that they are quite taken off from all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall duties, when it is with them, as with the young man in the Goſpel, <note place="margin">Mat. 19.12 Mat. 13.22</note> that when Chriſt told him, that <hi>if be would be perfect, he muſt ſell all he had, and give it to the poor, he went away ſorrowfull; for he had great poſſeſſions:</hi> this is a ſign their hearts are too much glewed to the things of the world, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.42. when <hi>Martha was cumbred about many things</hi> of the world, though theſe were expreſſions of her love to Chriſt, yet becauſe ſhe did neglect giving attendance in hearing Ghriſts voice, he told her, <hi>that ſhe was troubled about many 
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115133:199"/>things; but one thing was neceſſary, and</hi> Mary <hi>had choſen the better part that ſhould not be taken from her.</hi> When your follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trades takes you off, that you never read the word, or pray in your Families, or Cloſet, then is your affection to the world immoderate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When your tradings and affairs in the world does ſo take up your hearts, that you cannot take that ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment and comfort that God allows you in the bleſſings you enjoy, then you place inordinate affections upon the things of the world, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.12. <hi>The ſleep of a labouring man is ſweet; but the abundance of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleep.</hi> When men are ſo poſſeſſed, and taken up with the affairs of the world, that either for care of getting, fear of loſing, or hopes of increaſing, they cannot eat their bread in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor take their naturall reſt and ſleep: this is a ſign their hearts are too much glewed to the world, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.26. <hi>God giveth to a man that is good in his ſight, wiſdom and knowledge, and joy; but to the ſinner he giveth travell, to gather and heap up riches,</hi> he gives him diſquietneſs, vexation, and trouble of mind. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſets out a covetous man by a lively com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.14.15. he compares him to a Dog that is hungry, that <hi>at the evening returns and makes a noyſe, and goes round about the City, and wanders up and down for meat, and grudges if he be not ſatisfied.</hi> It is reported of the Dog, that when he is hungry, he hath a moſt enraged appetite, now ſaies he, <hi>let him run up and down like a Dog, and make a noiſe,</hi> for want of meat.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You are exceſſive in placing your affections upon your riches, when what you poſſeſs in the world, fills you with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and ſenſuality. What, ſaies the rich man in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>I have goods laid up for many years,</hi> there is his ſecurity, <hi>ſoul take thy eaſe, eat, drink and be merry;</hi> there is his ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As 'tis ſpoken of the Inhabitants of <hi>Hazor, Jer.</hi> 49.31. <hi>Go</hi> (ſaith God to the <hi>Babylonians</hi>) <hi>to the wealthy Nation that dwells without care.</hi> In <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.15. ſaies <hi>Solomon, the rich mans wealth is his ſtrong City, and as an high-wall in his own conceit.</hi> And thus did riches make <hi>David</hi> ſecure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.6.

                     <hi>In my proſperity</hi> I <hi>ſaid,</hi> I <hi>ſhall never be moved,</hi> then are your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to the things of the world exceſſive, when it breeds in your ſecurity and ſenſuality.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When your wealth proves ſerviceable and inſtrumental to your luſts, and is as fewel to your corruptions, then is your love to it inordinate; as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The labour of the righteous tendeth to life, but the revenues of the wicked tend to ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. When you make your wealth and riches fewel to feed your pride, as in <hi>Ezek</hi> 28.5. <hi>By thy great wiſdom, and by thy traffick haſt thou increaſed thy riches, and thy heart is lifted up becauſe of thy riches,</hi> ſaid God to the Prince of <hi>Tyre.</hi> If God gives you wealth, and as you grow high and rich in the world, you grow proud in heart too: this is a ſign you are immoderate in your affections to the world; and hence it is, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. <hi>chargeth thoſe that be rich in the world, that they be not high-minded, nor truſt in uncertain riches, but in the living</hi> God, <hi>who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When your wealth breeds uncompaſſionateneſs in you, and makes you deſpiſe and contemn the poor, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.3. 'Twas the rich man in the Goſpel, that let poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> lie at his Gate, and gave him nothing, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.2. <hi>He that hath this worlds good, and ſeeth his Brother have need, and ſhutteth up the bowels of his compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When you do, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.15. make your wealth your confidence, then are your affections immoderate to the things of the world, when you will part with nothing to pious and Chriſtian uſes, either for the furtherance of Gods glory, and worſhip, or for the good of man, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.17.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Then are your affections exceſſive upon the things of the world, when you are ſo inſatiable and eager after riches, <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.10.</note> that you never think you have enough. When men <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their deſires like hell,</hi> and are like the grave that will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſatisfied. When you are like thoſe ſpoken of in <hi>Eſay</hi> 56.11. <hi>that were greedy Doggs that could never have enough;</hi> ſuch men are ſlaves to their wealth, and their riches poſſeſſeth them more then they it. (Beloved) when you are thus eagen 
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115133:200"/>in your purſuit of riches, and ſo reſtleſſe in your deſires, after the things of the world, this ſhews that your affections are too much ſet upon them.

Another reaſon is, becauſe you know not what they ſhall be that ſhall enjoy what you labour for; you may take a great deal of pains in gathering and heaping up wealth, and yet leave it to them that will neither love you, nor thank you for it. Now ſhall I toil and moil in the world, and hazard my ſoul to get riches, when I may leave my Eſtate to I know not whom, that it may be, will neither love me, nor thank me

                  <p n="3">3 Do not place your affections exceſſively upon the world, becauſe you have better things pertaining to another world, that you ſhould place your affections upon, you have true la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and durable riches to rejoyce in, as reconciliation with <hi>God,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt, juſtification of your perſons, ſanctification of your natures, acceptation of your ſervices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you have all theſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in, and therefore why will you be ſo much in love with Pebbles, when you may have Pearls in the room of them; with Counters of Braſſe, when you may have peeces of Gold.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

(ſaies he) <hi>there is that withholdeth,</hi> (that is, withholdeth from the poor) <hi>and that tends to poverty,</hi> when God ſees that thou doeſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thy talent, and imploy what thou haſt to his glory, he will give thee more; but if not, he will take away what thou haſt, and give it to others that ſhall make better uſe of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You that buy and ſell and yet get nothing, take this advice; do not grudge at, nor envie the wealth and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that other men have and enjoy in the world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.7.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115133:202"/>ſaies <hi>David, Fret not thy ſelf becauſe of him that proſpereth in his way. David</hi> himſelf ſlipt into this fault almoſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.2.3. and <hi>Jeremy</hi> reaſons with God about it, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 12.1. The riches and poſſeſſions of wicked men it is their portion, and all they are like to have, and therefore do not envie them, but rather pitty them, becauſe their riches will be their ruine, and they are but like unto <hi>Oxen</hi> fatted for the ſlaughter. Will it grieve thee that thou goeſt on foot, when another rides to the place of execution?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You that can get nothing here below, do you labour to lay up a treaſure in Heaven: if you cannot get riches here, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to get grace here. If you cannot get gold, yet buy the Gold that Chriſt ſpeaks of in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. <hi>I counſel thee,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou maiſt be rich.</hi> If you cannot get goods, get grace; if you cannot get wealth, get Chriſt; if you cannot get earth, get Heaven.</p>
                  <p>And thus much by way of counſel to you that buy and ſell and get nothing: but now I have a word or two by way of comfort to you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Reſt contentedly ſatisfied with thy condition; and know, that if God denies thee poſſeſſions and increaſe by thy trading in the world, he ſees it is for thy good.

                     <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.13.</note> Now it may be the Lord ſees that if he ſhould give thee wealth and great poſſeſſions in the world, it would be for thy hurt, thy riches would be thy ruine, and thy wealth thy woe, and thy proſperitie a ſnare to thee; and therefore he keeps it from thee in a great deal of mercy. We ſhould look upon all the comforts that God keeps from us as ſo many mercies, becauſe God keeps that from us that would ruine us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God in his diſpenſations of outward bleſſings in the world, doth in his wiſdom think it beſt to let good men have the leaſt ſhare in theſe worldly poſſeſſions, and wicked men to have the greateſt. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.3. <hi>The wicked are not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued as other men; but their eyes ſtand out with fatneſs, and they have more then heart
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115133:203"/>can wiſh;</hi> they ſpend their dayes in jollity and mirth. But now on the other ſide, <note place="margin">James 2.5.</note> 
                     <hi>God hath choſen the poor of the world to be rich in faith, and heirs of a Kingdom:</hi> the wiſdom of God is very much diſcovered in thus diſpenſing his bleſſings, God doth herein like to a Noble-man, that will not ſuffer his Son to go from houſe to houſe, to gather in his yearly Rents; but imployes his Servant in ſo mean a work, and many times the Servant hath mony enough when the Son hath none. In <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 9.11. <hi>I returned, and ſaw under the Sun, that the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong, neither yet bread to the wiſe, nor yet riches to men of underſtanding.</hi> Wicked men ſhall have riches, when men of wiſdom and underſtanding ſhall have none; God in his wiſdom ſees it meet, that wiſe men ſhall ſcarce have bread to eat, when fools have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that men of underſtanding ſhall want, when wicked men have more then their hearts can wiſh. Now will you murmur and complain when God ſees it meet to be thus?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider for thy comfort, that God gives thee better riches then they have, and though he give wicked men the poſſeſſion of theſe outward comforts, yet you have the true right and title to theſe poſſeſſions: now who would be ſo fooliſh, as to count the Steward happier then the Heire? the Steward only hath it in poſſeſſion; but the Heir in propriety. And conſider, that if thou art one that belongs to the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace, though thou be never ſo poor here, yet thou haſt the only true and durable riches; <note place="margin">Rev. 2.9.</note> thou art inriched with thoſe treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge, and grace and happineſs that are at Gods right hand. And though God doth not truſt thee with Pebbles, yet if he gives thee Pearls, thou haſt no reaſon to complain: though God doth not truſt thee with riches, yet if he gives thee grace and Chriſt, and heaven and glory, thou haſt no reaſon to murmur againſt him. <hi>Acorns</hi> are good enough for Hogs, but bread is for the Children.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider, that the poorer you are in the world, the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you are for Gods ſervice. The lean Oxe is fitter for ſervice then the fatted Oxe: what if God keeps thee low and poor,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115133:203"/>ſeeing it is to make thee more capable of doing him ſervice, why ſhould you be troubled?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Conſider, that thou art free from the more cares and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances, by how much the leſſe the Lord gives thee here in this world; <hi>for they that will be rich fall into divers ſnares and temptations,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. Now which is beſt, either to go in a broad way where there is a ſnare laid for thee, or to go in a narrow way where you may go with ſafety, and without danger. And therefore (beloved) if God give you but a ſmall portion here below, why then ſay, I have the leſſe cares and troubles, and ſnares and incumbrances that rich men are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and expoſed to. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.2. tis ſaid, <hi>Abraham</hi> was rich, the word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is heavy; and ſo thoſe that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with riches, the Prophet <hi>Halbakuk</hi> expreſſeth it by a compaſſing about with thick Clay; they are ſo loaden with worldly enjoyments, that they cannot run the race that is ſet before them in the way to Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Conſider, that it may be thou haſt more peace and comfort, and contentedneſs in the little thou poſſeſſeſt, then many times wicked men have in their great abundance, you have many times more reall comfort in your ſcarcity and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury, then the wicked have in all their plenty. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.16. <hi>A little that the righteous man hath is better then the riches of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a wicked man.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 15.6.</note> Beloved, thoſe to whom God gives abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, they have every thing neat and neceſſary about them, yet they may have ſomething or other that pinches and troubles them; the condition of poverty, want and diſgrace, may be more eaſie in ſome reſpects. A Sattin Suit may more gall a rich man, then a Ruſſet Coat that a poor man weares does trouble him. God doth many times mingle care and trouble with the riches and abundance that wicked men have; but now a poor man, though he has but a little, yet he hath the bleſſing of God with it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.22. <hi>The bleſſing of God maketh rich, and he adds no ſorrow with it, Eccleſ.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Better is a bandfull with quietneſs, then both the hands full with travel and vexation of ſpirit:</hi> A little Eſtate with peace and contentedneſs is better then twice as much with ſorrow and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115133:204"/>care. Suppoſe thou art a poor man, yet it may be thou haſt more comfort in what thou haſt, then the rich have in their affluence and confluence of all worldly things. Now conſider with your ſelves, is it not better for thee to wear a Ruſſet Coat, and have a ſound and healthy body, then to be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Sattin and Purple, and have a Leproſie all over thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?

Mens honours change their manners, whiles they increaſe in wealth, they decreaſe in grace. The people of God are uſually better in a ſtate of affliction then proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And thus you ſhall find, that <hi>David</hi> was a great deal better, when he was hunted by <hi>Saul, like a Patridge upon the Mountains,</hi> then when he ſate upon the Throne. Therefore 'tis ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.3. that <hi>Jehoſaphat walked in the firſt wayes of David</hi> his <hi>Father;</hi> it ſeems his laſt wayes were not ſo good: many men in their laſt dayes, when they come to be aged and wealthy, they are then even poſſeſſed with their riches, and they are in their hearts (it may be) when they are not in their hands: and therefore conſider ſeriouſly with your ſelves, whether your firſt dayes in the world were not your beſt dayes, and now your laſt and richeſt dayes, your worſt dayes. It is obſerved of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they were better under bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> then they were in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where they had all things needfull; for then they waxed proud and forgot the Lord: therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> gives them ſuch a caution, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. from verſe 7. to 15.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider this beloved, that your wealth and poſſeſſions in the world, though they may be lawfull and honeſtly got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115133:207"/>yet they lay you under a greater difficulty of coming to Heaven, then other men; in <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.23.24. when Chriſt told the young man, that <hi>if he would be perfect, he muſt go ſell all that he had, and give to the poor, he went away ſorrowfull, for he had great poſſeſſions. Then ſaid Jeſus to his diſciples, how hardly ſhall a rich man enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. And again, I ſay unto you, it is eaſier for a Cammel to go through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Upon how hard tearms can a rich man hope to go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? ſome are of opinion, that the word here tranſlated Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, properly ſignifies a Cable Rope, and Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> is of that judgement too; and ſaies he, though a Cable Rope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go through a needles eye, as it is, yet if you untwiſt it, there is a poſſibility of getting it through. So if men do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twiſt themſelves from the world, and live with weaned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from their wealth and poſſeſſions, this is the way for them to come to heaven. Heaven is compared to a ſtately palace, with a narrow Gate, the expreſsion ſhews a great deal of difficulty for rich men to go to Heaven. <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> ſet it forth with a patheticall emphaſis, oh how hard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſaies Chriſt, <hi>That which is impoſſible with man, is poſſible with God.</hi> The riches of the world are perplexing and alluring va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and laies you under the greater difficulty of coming to Heaven, and it is a hundred to one, but they do enſnare and entangle you.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Conſider, that you to whom God hath given great poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsions in the world, are expoſed to more diſtracting and diſtorting and diſquietting cares, then poor men are; for they have no cauſe to complain of their poverty, if they have but food and rayment, becauſe they are free from thoſe cares and troubles that are incident to rich men; who would deſire ſilken Stockins, if he muſt have gouty Leggs under them? and indeed the Gout is a diſeaſe that ordinarily follows rich men? or deſire a Sattin Doublet, or a purple Robe, to have a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous and infirm body under them? ſo it is better for you to be poor as you are, then to have riches, and ſo many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and croſſes and afflictions, with them. In 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9,10.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115133:207"/>ſaies the Apoſtle there, <hi>they that will be rich fall into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtfull luſts, which drown men in perdition and deſtruction; for the love of money is the root of all evill, which while ſome have coveted after, they have pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.12. <hi>The reſt of a labouring man is ſweet, but the abundance of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleep.</hi> So in Eccleſ. 2.26. <hi>God giveth to the ſinner travell, both in gathering and heaping up of riches,</hi> he meets with a great deal of ſorrow and trouble which a poor man is without: therefore riches are compared to thorns, you can hardly graſpe them with your hand, but they will pierce &amp; wound you. A rich man hath three vultures continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally feeding on his heart, great care in getting, fear in keeping, grief in parting, and this hinders his quiet. It is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the ſame word in the Hebrew that ſignifies Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, ſignifies trouble, to note unto us, that thoſe that do entangle themſelves in the affairs of the world, will meet with a great deal of trouble, and anguiſh, and vexation with it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Conſider, that many times your wealth and riches doth ſtifle and interrupt the ſucceſs and power, and benefit of the word of God upon your ſouls. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.22. it is ſpoken of the thorny ground, that <hi>the deceitfulneſs of riches choaked the word, and made it altogether unfruitfull.</hi> Can a crop of Corn grow in a hedge of thorns? no more can the word thrive in a heart filled with worldly cares.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, it may be theſe awakening conſiderations that I have laid before you concerning riches, may make ſome of you go home with a reſolution, never to be rich, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after a great Eſtate in the world; but do not miſtake me, and conclude from hence that it is a ſin to be rich, it is a danger to be rich, but not a ſin, it is a ſnare and temptation, and therefore you ſhould take care, both how you get, and how you uſe and imploy your riches.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe there is a danger in wealth, do not therefore caſt away your wealth, and ſpend it idly and waſtfully, and throw away the bleſſings of God from you. As 'tis reported
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115133:208"/>of <hi>Crates</hi> the <hi>Thebane,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Directions how to procure Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon our Eſtate, thereby to preſerve and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe them.</note> who ſaid of his wealth, <hi>Ego perdam te ne tu perdas me.</hi> Ile deſtroy thee, leaſt thou ſhouldſt deſtroy me. And this brings me to the 3d particular I promiſed to handle, namely, to give you ſome uſefull directions and admonitions how you may do to have Gods bleſſing upon your Eſtates, and thereby have them both preſerved and increaſed. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Seaſon thy poſſeſſions with grace, get grace to be ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with thy goods, and get the true riches to be mingled with thy worldly wealth; and this is the way to preſerve and improve them. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.1.3. ſaies the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in his Commandements, his ſeed ſhall be mighty upon the earth, wealth and riches ſhall be in his houſe.</hi> When God bid <hi>Solomon</hi> aske what he would of him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.12. he did not aske riches, but <hi>wiſdom and knowledge, and an underſtanding heart,</hi> and ſaies God to him, <hi>becauſe this was in thy heart, and thou haſt not asked riches, wealth, or honour, therefore</hi> ſaies God, <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge is granted to thee, and thou ſhalt have riches and wealth, and honours likewiſe, ſuch as none of the Kings have had, that have been before thee, neither ſhall any after thee have the like.</hi> Beloved, you ſhould <hi>firſt ſeek the Kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs, and then all other things ſhall be added to you.</hi> The way to keep and increaſe your riches, is to get grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your hearts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Imploy part of your increaſe to pious and Chriſtian uſes, to promote and advance Religion, and do it in your life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9.10. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy ſubſtance, and with the firſt fruits of all thine increaſe,</hi> (that is) give it to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous uſes, what then? <hi>ſo ſhall thy barnes be filled with plenty, and thy preſſes ſhall burſt out with new wine.</hi> In token of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God for his bleſſing, improve part of them to his glory, for good and pious uſes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Give up part of thy increaſe to charitable uſes, towards the relieving the neceſſities of the poor, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.24. <hi>There is that ſcattereth, and yet increaſeth, and there is that withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more then is meet; but it tendeth to poverty.</hi> A penurious withholding tends to poverty, God may blaſt an Eſtate that 
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115133:208"/>is well gotten if it be ill kept, works of mercy done prudently were never a hinderance, but rather a furtherance to mens outward Eſtates. As in other gifts the good uſage of them doth bring an augmentation: ſo in theſe 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.10. the Apoſtle calls works of charity <hi>ſeed ſown.</hi> No field ſo fruitfull to ſowe in, as the poor Members of Chriſt, no ſeed better then mercy, no Crop of Corn ſo commodious as liberality will bring you. Yet <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.5. give with diſcretion. <hi>The wiſe man is mercifull, but he orders his affairs with diſcretion.</hi> You ſhould be diſcreet in conſidering how much you ought to give according to your ability, and no more; and when, and to whom you muſt give, not hand over head, to tag and rag, to every begger that goes up and down the ſtreets, without any difference; but to thoſe poor men that follow a Calling, and if they be able, do take pains to live in the world, and ſuch as walk holily and religiouſly; if you do thus give, I will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, you ſhall never be the poorer man at the years end, or at leaſt at your lives end; but to be a penurious man, is the way to be a poor man.</p>
                  <p>As things ill gotten are ſoon loſt, ſo things ill kept will not long continue. If you would have Gods bleſſing upon your poſſeſsions, be of a tender and compaſsionate diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards the poor. And do not only give to thoſe that come and beg of you, but do you go and find out the poor, <note place="margin">Eſa. 32.8.</note> and relieve them. <hi>The liberall,</hi> ſaies the Prophet Eſay, <hi>will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe how to give liberally:</hi> you ſhould ſeek out, where is the man that I may do moſt good to relieve and ſuccour? <hi>Throw your money upon the waters and after many days you ſhall find it again,</hi> 'tis a proverbiall ſpeech for fruitleſs charges, we uſe to ſay, I might as well have thrown my money down the River; <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11.12.</note> ſo though it may ſeem that you had as good caſt your money into the water, yet you ſhall find, that God before the years end, will bring about an increaſe, and a good advantage for all that you have given away to the poor, for Chriſt ſake. And therefore be not reſerv'd and niggardly towards the poor, do not only give a morſell of bread at your door, that your Neighbour may ſee you, but give in ſecret when no
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115133:209"/>body ſees you, and give to them that moſt need your charity, and this is the way for God, both to bleſſe and increaſe your riches.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And laſtly, you whom God hath bleſſed in your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and enlarged your poſſeſsions, follow your Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcionably and diligently ſtill: as God hath bleſſed thee hitherto, ſo do not now uſe any indirect or falſe wayes to get more riches, but follow thy Calling honeſtly ſtll, for <hi>the Hand of the diligent</hi> ſaies <hi>Solomon, makes rich, and in all labour there is profit, but the talk of the lips tendeth onely to penury.</hi>

                  <p>And thus I have done with theſe two branches: firſt I ſpake ſomething to thoſe that buy and ſell, and follow a Trade in the world, and yet can ſcarce bring the year about.</p>
                  <p>And now I have ſpoken ſomething to thoſe that buy and ſell, and have gotten great Eſtates and poſſeſsions in the world, and that juſtly and honeſtly.</p>
                  <p>And in the afternoon I ſhall ſpend an hour in ſpeaking to thoſe that have gotten poſſeſsions and riches in the world; but diſhoneſtly and fraudulently.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. You may conjecture that man to have come by his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate diſhoneſtly, that has gotten a great Eſtate ſuddenly. When a man from a begger ſhall ſuddenly become a rich man. That's a notable paſſage, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.20. <hi>He that makes haſt to be rich</hi> ſaies Solomon, <hi>ſhall not be innocent,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a curſe annexed to it in <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.21. <hi>An inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance may be gotten haſtily at the beginning, but the end thereof ſhall not be bleſſed.

When a man ſhall follow a Trade, &amp; honeſt gain, when no man of the ſame Calling &amp; Trade with get a great Eſtate by it, &amp; another man of the ſame Profeſſion, cannot live half ſo well, though his pains and diligence be as much, and his returns as great as his. 'Tis a ſign that there is ſome myſtery of iniquity that he hath in driving his trade; compare <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.2. with <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.13. The poor and rich, and the poor and the deceitfull.

I come now to the ſecond; what cautelary Rules and directions may be given to ſuch men, as have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten riches and poſſeſſions unjuſtly? I ſhall give you three of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take this Rule, let it not ſatisfie your Conſcience, nor do you think it will bear you out in your unjuſt gains, that what you have gotten unjuſtly and irreligiouſly in your life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, you will imploy religiouſly, &amp; charitably at your death.</p>
                  <p>Many men are apt to think, that when they have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and deceitfull dealers all their life-time, if they imploy what they have unjuſtly gotten, to good uſes when they die, to give Legacies, build Hoſpitalls or Churches, that they are well enough, and do therein give God ſatisfaction for all their injuſtice; but it is not ſo, God will not be ſatisfied with ſuch offerings. God doth not love a ſacrifice that is gotten by rapine and violence. <hi>Eſay</hi> 61.8. ſaies God there, <hi>I love judgement, and hate robberies for burnt offerings.</hi> And it is very obſervable, that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.18. the Lord gave an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe charge, that they ſhould not bring to the Altar, <hi>the hire of a whore, to offer it unto God,</hi> the Lord could not abide, that the money that was the hire of a whore, or the price of a Dog, ſhould be offered up to him in a ſacrifice. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſider, you that imploy to good uſes the mony gotten by oppreſſion, violence and deceit, the Lord will not be well pleaſed with it, this is the firſt direction.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>2</label> 2. Think ſpeedily of making a reſtitution, if you expect ſalvation make a reſtitution to thoſe whom you have wronged, God had rather you ſhould make reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to thoſe you have injured, then that you ſhould build Hoſpitalls with it, or convert it to any other pious or charitable uſe: ſaith <hi>Zacheus, if I have taken away any thing from any man, by any falſe wayes, I will reſtore him fourfold. Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Selymus,</hi> when his Counſellour <hi>Pyrrbus</hi> perſwaded him to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115133:210"/>beſtow the great wealth he had taken from the <hi>Perſian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, upon ſome notable Hoſpital for the Relief of the poor; the dying <hi>Turk</hi> commanded it, rather to be reſtored to the right owners. When <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>England</hi> ſent the Frier <hi>Minors</hi> a load of <hi>Freeze</hi> to cloath them, they returned it back with this Meſſage, that he ought not to give Alms of what he had taken from the poor unjuſtly; neither would they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of that abominable gift. See <hi>Levit.</hi> 6.4.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Do not juſtifie your ſelf in a courſe of diſhoneſt gain, when your conſcience tells you, that you have dealt unjuſtly. This was the great ſin of <hi>Ephraim</hi> in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12.7. <hi>Ephraim is a Merchant, the ballances of deceit are in his hand, he loveth to oppreſs. And Ephraim ſaid, yet I am become rich, I have found me out ſubſtance; in all my labours they ſhall find none iniquity in me that were ſin.</hi> He juſtified himſelf, though the ballances of deceit were in his band; but do not you do ſo; for though you do, yet God will not juſtifie you: In <hi>Mica</hi> 6.11. ſaies God there, <hi>ſhall I count them pure, that have a deceitfull ballance, or ſhall I count them honeſt that have a bag of deceitfull waights?</hi> no, I will not do it ſaies God.</p>
                  <p>I now come to lay down ſome terrifying and aſtoniſhing Conſiderations. <note place="margin">Six terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations for thoſe that have gotten their Eſtates diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly.</note> All you that have gotten your Eſtates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly and diſhoneſtly, let theſe ſix terrible conſiderations lie near your hearts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Confider, that an Eſtate ill gotten, is in the ſight of God no better then robbery, though it be gotten in a way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and trading in the world. God looks upon it as rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, as if you had plaid the thief, and ſtole it out of a mans houſe, or pickt his pocket. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.10. <hi>Truſt not in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſiou, become not vain in robberies,</hi> oppreſſion and Robbery is all one. So in <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.6.7. <hi>The getting of Treaſures by a lying Tongue, is a vanity toſſed to and fro of them that ſeek death. The robbery of the wicked ſhall deſtroy them, becauſe they refuſe to do judgement.</hi> An Eſtate gotten by a lying tongue, is called by God robbery, or a ſtealing with the tongue, and though we do not account it ſo, yet it is no other in Gods account, then if you did rob a man, or pick his pocket.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:115133:211"/>And therefore beloved, it is very obſervable, that what God required as a reſtitution, for things that were ſtolen, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.1,2,3. was given by <hi>Zacheus</hi> for thoſe things which he had got unjuſtly, though he did not ſteal them: <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.1. <hi>If a man did ſteal a ſheep,</hi> the law was, that <hi>he ſhould reſtore four fold:</hi> ſo <hi>David</hi> judges, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.6. and <hi>Zacheus</hi> though he was not a thief, yet ſaies he, <hi>If I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any thing from any man unjuſtly, I will reſtore him four fold,</hi> which notes to us, that things gotten by a deceitfull tongue, and riches gotten by oppreſſion, is in the ſight of God no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then robbery: &amp; beloved, none of you would be willing to have the brand of a thief upon you, when indeed you are ſo, &amp; no better in Gods account, if you get an Eſtate diſhoneſtly.</p>

Conſider, that if ever God awaken your Conſcience, you cannot look upon your unjuſt gains, but with abundance of diſquietneſs and horrour, and perplexity of ſpirit: it may be now <hi>ſtolen waters are ſweet, and the bread of deceitfulneſs is pleaſant to you;</hi> but when God comes to awaken your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, oh what horrour and terrour, and conſternation will ſeaze upon your ſpirits, <hi>Job</hi> 20.15.18.20. <hi>He hath ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down riches, and he ſhall vomit them up again,</hi> the riches that a man hath gotten unjuſtly, ſhall be like meat that lies undigeſted in a mans ſtomach, and forceth him to vomit up again, and in verſe 18. <hi>That which he laboured for ſhall he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore, and ſhall not ſwallow it down, ſurely he ſhall not feel quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in his belly,</hi> that is in his Conſcience.

When a man cometh to die &amp; ſhal conſider, all this wealth that I have labored for in my life, muſt leave me at my death, &amp; that your riches are the price of your ſouls, and that they have been gotten by defrauding and over-reaching your Neighbour, by lying and cheating, and oppreſſion; How can ſuch a man look God in the face? <hi>Eſay</hi> 33.14. <hi>who ſhall dwell with the devouring fire? who ſhall dwell with the everlaſting burnings? he that walketh righteouſly, and ſpeaketh uprightly, and deſpiſeth the gain of oppreſſion.</hi> None of thoſe that uſe diſhoneſt gain, and defraud their Brethren, can look God in the face, what horrour and terrour of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will it be to you, when you come to die? to conſider, that all your riches are purchaſed with your ſouls blood.

And thoſe that were moſt eager to take their poſſeſſions firſt, the Lord was pleaſed to make them loſe their poſſeſſions a great while before any of the other loſt theirs, as you may ſee, a <hi>King.</hi> 10.33. I only mention this to let you ſee, that though you be never ſo haſty in getting an Eſtate, yet God may quickly take it from you. You have another notable Text for this purpoſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.11. <hi>As the Partridge ſitteth on eggs, and hatcketh them not, ſo he that getteth riches, and not by right, ſhall leave them in the midſt of his dayes, and at his end ſhall be a fool.</hi>

A Lapide</hi> hath a notable Fable to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, comparing men that are unjuſt in their dealings to Spiders, the righteous man to a Bee.

                  <p>And thus I have done with theſe three branches of the uſe, directed to three ſorts of people, 1. To thoſe that buy and ſell in the world, and can ſcarce bring the year about. 2. To thoſe that trade in the world, and get great Eſtates, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly and diſhoneſtly. And laſtly, to thoſe that have got great Eſtates and Poſſeſſions, by juſt and commendable courſes. I ſhall now conclude all with another ſhort and practical uſe, and ſo have done.</p>
                  <p>I have already ſpent 4. Sermons about this buſineſs of commerce and trading in the world, and all that I ſhall now ſay by way of uſe in the cloſe of this ſubject, ſhall be this, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to exhort and beſeech you in the midſt of all your buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſellings in the world, to drive a Trade for Heaven, and to labour to poſſeſs grace as well as worldly goods, and to encourage you herein, let me but offer theſe three things to your conſideration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Do not you expect ſome gain and increaſe by your Trades? there is not one of you but think to get by your Trading. O therefore do not drive a Trade for Heaven, and yet never labour to increaſe and grow better and better by it.

Do you expect to gain by your worldly Tradings? and doth not God expect, that in your Tradings for Heaven, you ſhould gain more grace and more knowledge, more experience, humility, holineſs, heavenly mindedneſs, and the like?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Would it not be matter of grief to you, to continue a long time, buying and ſelling, and trading in the world, and yet not increaſe your ſtock, would not this grieve you Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved? and ſhall it not grieve you too, that you have been trading for Heaven a long time, and yet from your firſt ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping forth to this inſtant, have gotten no increaſe? and would it not grieve you to decline in your Eſtates, after all your labour and pains, and trading in the world, and ſhould it not grieve you much more to be further off from Heaven now, then you were at firſt?</p>

                  <p>In the proſecution of this point I ſhall thus proceed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To give you the reaſons why you muſt not abuſe the lawfull comforts of this world.</p>

And laſtly, I ſhall give you ſome directions, how a Chriſtian may ſo uſe the lawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of this life, as not to abuſe them.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt, and ſhew you the reaſons why you muſt not abuſe the lawfull comforts of this life.</p>
                  <p>There are four potent reaſons for it, two of them found in Scripture, and the other two deduced from Scripture. <note place="margin">Reaſons why we ſhould not abuſe the lawfull comforts of this life.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Abuſe nothing you uſe; why? becauſe nothing that you uſe is your own, but Gods, he is the true owner of all that you poſſeſs, and you know it is a part of diſhoneſty to abuſe other mens goods. All that you have is Gods, <hi>the Cattle upon a thouſand hills are his,</hi> your Corn and wine are Gods, and if you uſe any of them to exceſs or drunkenneſs, you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe that which is none of yours, this is the firſt reaſon drawn from Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are two reaſons found in Scripture, why you ſhould not abuſe the comforts you injoy; the one before my Text, and the other after it. That before my Text is this; <hi>but this I ſay Brethren</hi>
(ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>the time is ſhort, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth therefore, that whatſoever you uſe in the world,</hi> ſeeing you cannot uſe them long, <hi>you ſhould uſe them well:</hi> our time is ſhort, and therefore do not abuſe the comforts you injoy, The reaſon after my Text is, becauſe all our comforts are fleeting and fading, and running away from us, therefore <hi>uſe the world as not abuſing of it, for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away;</hi> they paſs away with Eagles wings, but they come to you with the wings of a Sparrow: your comforts do vaniſh away like ſmoak, <note place="margin">Sic tranſit gloria mundi.</note> and therefore it was a cuſtom in <hi>Rome,</hi> when the Pope went by, there was an Officer appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to burn flax before him, which put him in mind, that all his honour and riches ſhould ſoon vaniſh and paſſe away like the ſmoak. And it was a good meditation that one had ſtanding by a River ſide; ſaies he, the water which I ſee, now runs away, and I ſee it no more, ſo the comforts of this world are like the running River, that are ſtill gliding and running away from us: ſeeing therefore we cannot enjoy theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts

There are more die by meat, then by poyſon. It was the judgement of a learned man, that he thought there were more went to Hell, by doing of lawfull things unlawfully, then by doing thoſe things that in themſelves are meerly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and unlawfull, palpable and groſſe wickedneſs is eaſily checkt and withſtood; but who ſuſpects lawfull things: When a man is eating or drinking? who ſuſpects that <hi>his Table ſhould be made a ſnare to him?</hi> and he that marries a wife, little dreams that ſhe ſhould unſofder this conjunction with Jeſus Chriſt, and he that buyes and ſells, and trades in the world, little ſuſpects that he is then ſelling away his ſoul: therefore take heed that you do not abuſe lawfull things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men are naturally more apt and prone to abuſe lawfull things, then to do thoſe things, which the very doing of them is ſinfull and unlawfull: you may loſe your ſelves in ſaving your comforts, <hi>licitis perimus omnes.</hi> Surfet with jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets and ſweet meats hath deſtroyed more then eating what is bitter of taſte. It is very obſervable, that in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.18. there were three ſorts of people that made their apology, why they would not come to the Supper of the great King, and none of them did plead any thing that was ſinfull, as an excuſe of their abſence; but ſaies one, <hi>I have bought a piece of ground, and I muſt needs go and ſee it, I pray thee have me excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and another ſaid, <hi>I have bought five Yoak of Oxen, and I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115133:216"/>therefore it requires our care and circumſpection, that we do not offend in this particular.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have done with the firſt queſtion, why we muſt not abuſe the lawfull comforts of this life.</p>

                     <note place="margin">When a man may be ſaid to abuſe the lawfull comforts of this life.</note>We come now to the ſecond, and that is to ſhew you, when a man may be ſaid in the uſe of lawfull comforts to abuſe them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall give it you in theſe four or five particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A man may be ſaid to abuſe the lawfull comforts of this life, when they do uſe them too affectionately. Many men do hug their comforts ſo cloſe in their Arms, that they ſpoil them, as the Ape kills her young by hugging them too hard. Beloved, did you but gently and moderately uſe the things of the world, the luſter, and beauty, and comforts of them would remain longer with you; but by cruſhing of them, and loving them too much, you ſpoil them. <hi>If riches increaſe, ſet not your hearts upon them:</hi> it is a good obſervation that one hath upon that place, <hi>Job</hi> 38.22. where God challengeth <hi>Job,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>haſt thou entred into the treaſures of Snow, or haſt thou ſeen the treaſures of the Hail.</hi> Saies he, all the comforts of this world are but like treaſures of Snow. If you take a handfull of Snow, and cruſh it in your hand, it will melt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way preſently; but if you let it lie upon the ground, it will continue a pretty while: and ſo it is with the things of this world; if you take the comforts of this life in your hands, and lay them too near your hearts in affection and love to them, they will quickly melt and vaniſh away from you. But if you leave them in their proper place, and do not ſet an inordinate affection upon them, they will continue the longer with you. If you line a Garment with linnen, it doth well; but if you line it with pitch or glew, that it ſticks to the body, you ſpoil both the Garment, and the man that wears it: ſo when the world is glewed to your hearts, it ſpoils the comforts of the mercies you enjoy, ſo that this is the firſt thing, wherein a man may be ſaid to uſe the lawfull comforts of this life abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fively, when he uſeth them too affectionately; for whatſoever
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115133:217"/>a man loves exceſſively, he makes a God of it; the covetous man makes a God of his Gold, the ambitious man of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this is a great abuſe of the Creature to make Gods of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Men abuſe lawfull things in their uſe, when they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the things of the world, which in themſelves are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, too eagerly, <hi>when men do riſe early, and go to bed late, and eat the bread of carefulneſs,</hi> and lie down in ſorrow, being intent on nothing but the world, as thoſe <hi>James</hi> 4.13. when a man does thus, he abuſeth the world in the uſing of it.</p>

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But when may a man be ſaid too eagerly to uſe the things of this world?</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> I anſwer. 1. When thy worldly imployments interrupt thee in holy performances, then you are too eager in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of worldly things; though you do follow your Trade, which is lawfull and commendable, yet if this makes thee neglect the duties of Gods ſervice, as Family-duties, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then you do abuſe lawfull things, and therein conſiſted <hi>Martha's</hi> abuſe of lawfull things in <hi>Luke</hi> 10.40. <hi>Martha, Martha, thou art carefull, and troubled about many things,</hi> ſaies Chriſt, ſhe was troubled about the matters of the houſe; but ſhe neglected the one thing neceſſary, the hearing of Chriſts voice. And therefore all you that are Tradeſmen, &amp; men of great imployments in the world, take a ſerious ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey over your own hearts, conſider whether you do not rob God of his due, and by your too eagerly purſuing the things of the world, neglect the duties of his ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When you cannot take that naturall refreſhment in the bleſſings of God, which he allowes; when you cannot eat your bread with quietneſs, you are ſo perplext and ingulpht in the world, that when (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaies) <hi>by reaſon of your abundance you cannot ſleep,</hi> when you have neither time to eat by day, or ſleep by night, then you are too eager about the things of this world. And thirdly, when a man is reſtleſs and unſatisfied with his condition, he would be greater and richer then he is, and drive a greater Trade then he does, this is to be too eager upon the things of the world.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:115133:217"/>3. Another thing wherein men abuſe the lawfull things of this world in their uſe, is when they uſe them too depending<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; when they truſt, and rely and depend too much upon the things of this world. The comforts of this life may well be compared to the Reeds of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that if a man leane upon them, would not only deceive his expectations, and break under him; but pierce and run into his hand: ſo if you rely too much upon the things of this world, they will break and fruſtrate your hopes, and fly away from you, and pierce you through with many ſorrowes. It is a good obſervation that one hath, (ſaies he) The World hangs upon nothing, and therefore why ſhould we depend upon that which hath no foundation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A man uſeth lawfull things abuſively, when he uſes the world too carkingly, when a man ſhal be ſo troubled with ſolicitouſneſs what ſhall become of him and his Family hereafter, in his old age, that he cannot enjoy any comfort, or quietneſs in what he poſſeſſes for the preſent, then he abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the things of this world. The things of this world are not durable and laſting, and therefore we ſhould not ſet our hearts upon them, or be troubled at our future Eſtates; but <hi>live without care,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaies in the next verſe to my Text, we ſhould not be too carking and ſollicitous about the things of the world.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>3</label> We come now to the third Query, what a Chriſtian ſhould do, that in the uſe of the lawfull comforts of this life he may not abuſe them? but that he may uſe lawfull things lawfully. what courſe ſhould a Chriſtian take, that he may do thus?</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> I ſhall diſpatch this very briefly, and ſhew you in 4 par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, how you may do to uſe lawfull things lawfully, and not to abuſe them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If you would uſe lawfull things lawfully, uſe them ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, and then you will not uſe them abuſively; uſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things with a heavenly mind. As wicked men do uſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things carnally, ſo ſhould you uſe carnall things ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, that is, while you are about carnall things, you
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115133:218"/>ſhould make a ſpirituall uſe of them. And thus our Saviour did, when the people came about him for bread, he took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion thereby, to tell them, of <hi>the bread of life,</hi> and of <hi>that Mannah that came down from Heaven, that a man might eat thereof and not die.</hi> So when the <hi>Samaritan</hi> woman was bufie at the well, drawing of water, Chriſt from thence took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to tell her of the water of life; of <hi>living water, that if a man drinks thereof he ſhould never thirſt more.</hi> Thus did Chriſt improve carnall things ſpiritually. A man may lawfully talk and diſcourſe of worldly things, of buying and ſelling, and trading; but ſtill in the cloſe, there ſhould be a touch of ſomething thats ſpirituall and heavenly. A man will never uſe the world well, till he uſes it ſpiritually: one that treats upon this ſubject, ſaies, that as he ſate once in his ſtudy, he ſaw a little Robin-red-breaſt, pitch upon his window, chirping; and he preſently made this ſpirituall uſe of it. Saies he, this poor Bird that knowes not where to abide, but to reſt upon a hedge, and knowes not where to have a bit of meat, or where ſhe ſhall pick up the next crum, yet ſhe can ſing and be merry, and therefore why ſhould I that have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of the things of this world, be dejected and troubled with care and ſolicitouſneſs for them?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Uſe the things of this world reflexively, and then you will not uſe them abuſively. Reflect from the world up to God. When you are enjoying any of the comforts of this life, and find a reliſh and ſweetneſs in any of the Creatures, then by way of reflexion, conſider, that if there be ſuch a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deliciouſneſs in the Creature, what a ſweetneſſe is there in God the Creator? if there be ſo much beauty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in the Creature, how much beauty and glory, and tranſcendent excellency is there in God, and in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt? if there be ſo much light and brightneſs in a Candle, what is the light of the Sun, &amp; the glory of Heaven, and the ſplendor of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times brighter then the Sun? If you do thus uſe the world, you will not abuſe it. If the Creature be ſo full of goodneſs and ſweenteſs, how full is God? if there be ſuch 
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115133:218"/>comfort in having an eſtate here below, what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort is there in having grace in our hearts, &amp; to enjoy thoſe treaſures that are <hi>incorruptible, and fade not away, which neither the moath nor ruſt can corrupt, nor theeves break through and ſteal,</hi> uſe the world as a Looking-glaſſe, which caſts a reflexion, not as a mud-wall. O beloved, if we could thus in the uſe of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comforts, look up to God, and reflect upon the giver of them, we ſhould never abuſe them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You muſt uſe the comforts of the world weanedly with weaned affections from them. Thus <hi>David</hi> did, though he were the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſate upon the Throne, yet he was <hi>as a weaned Child,</hi> to the things of the world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131. verſe 1.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, you that have great Eſtates in the world, ſhould yet live with weaned affections from the world; the Script<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re does not only enjoyn Chriſtians to <hi>crucifie the fleſh;</hi> but <hi>the world</hi> too, <hi>They that are Chriſt, have</hi> not only <hi>crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts,</hi> as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. but they are <hi>crucified to the world too: thus</hi> Paul was; ſaies he, <hi>I am cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified to the world, and the world is crucified to me:</hi> the world did not care a pin for <hi>Paul,</hi> and he did not care a pin for the world; he that will uſe the world well, muſt uſe it wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If you would not uſe the comforts of the world abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, you muſt uſe them orderly; <hi>firſt ſeek the Kingdom of God, and the righteouſneſs thereof, and then all other things ſhall be added to you, Mat.</hi> 6.33. before you ſeek after the world, you ſhould ſeek the things of Heaven; ſeek the Kingdom of Heaven firſt in your judgements and eſteem, as the chief and ſupreme object of your deſires and delight, let the chief bent of your heart be after ſpirituall things, make this your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for which you were ſent into the world: you may ſeek after the things of the world; but when you have them, you muſt uſe them in a way of ſubſerviency to heavenly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things; you may follow your Calling in obedience to Gods Command; but let your aims be thereby to be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to maintain your Family, to ſerve God in that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115133:219"/>and place he hath ſet you, to relieve the poor, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the needy, and ſupport others that want the help and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of your charity; you ſhould have an eye upon ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, as being chiefly to be lookt after, and uſe all your comforts as ſo many ſteps to advance you nearer Heaven, you ſhould be ſubſervient to God in whatſoever condition he hath placed you, and not uſe the world for the worlds ſake, and follow a Calling, and buy and ſell meerly to get gain, and to grow rich and great in the world, making Religion and godlineſs ſubſervient to the world; for this is a very great abuſe of the world: but let all things here below, be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary and ſubſervient to ſpirituall and heavenly things.</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable, that in the Lords Prayer, where there are five Petitions for ſpirituall things, there is but one for temporall things, and that is, <hi>give us this day our daily bread,</hi> to note and intimate to us, that our deſires and endeavours ſhould be moſt after ſpirituall things. And beſides, theſe are petitioned for in the firſt place, before worldly things, to note, that the things of the world ſhould be ſubſervient to ſpirituall things. Theſe are four Rules, which if you obſerve, you will not uſe the world abuſively.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have gone over the Doctrinall part of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; I ſhall only ſpeak a word or two by way of application, and ſo have done.</p>

                     </label> 
                     <hi>Caution</hi> 1. If you muſt not abuſe worldly things, then much more ought you to take heed, that you do not abuſe ſpirituall things in your uſe of them. You muſt be carefull that your practiſes be anſwerable to your Profeſſions, and not profeſs much, and practiſe little. Do not make Religion a Cloak to impiety. You uſe to come to Church, and frequent the Ordinances of God; but take heed that you do not abuſe this practiſe, and make it a Cloak to cover ſome ſecret villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or impiety. Do not abuſe the word of God, nor uſe thy tongue to ſcoffe and jeer at the Scriptures; do not abuſe your
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115133:220"/>gifts, nor graces, nor contemn and deſpiſe thoſe that want them. If a man be carefull not to abuſe an Iron tool or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, he will be much more carefull, that he does not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe a ſilver or a golden one; if you muſt not abuſe things of an inferior and baſer nature, then much more ſhould you not abuſe things of a higher and more excellent nature. If you muſt not abuſe worldly things, then much leſſe ſpirituall things; therefore abuſe not Ordinances, abuſe not Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor Sermons, nor the means of grace, by living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfully, and unprofitably under them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Take this caution, that theſe advices of the Apoſtle, <hi>to weep as if we wept not, &amp; to rejoyce as if we rejoyced not, &amp; to buy as if we poſſeſſed not,</hi> are not to be extended to any ſpiritual performances; but only to outward things. The Apoſtle does not bid you weep for ſin, as if you wept not, neither doth he bid you rejoyce in God, and Chriſt, as if you rejoyced not; nor does he bid you uſe ſpirituall things, as if you uſed them not, and buy the things of God, as if you poſſeſſed not: there are many men, that in the uſe of worldly things, will rejoyce as if they were made up of nothing but joy and mirth, and as if all their bliſſe &amp; happineſs did conſiſt in theſe outward comforts; and many there are that can almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve into tears, for outward loſſes, troubles, or afflictions; but when they come to rejoyce in ſpirituall things, they can then rejoyce as if they rejoyced not, and in mourning for ſin, they can weep as if they wept not, and uſe the things of God as if they uſed them not. Oh how oppoſite and contrary do men go to the rule of the bleſſed Apoſtle here, they can pray as if they prayed not, they do not pray, even while they are a praying. Men ſhould uſe a moderation and indifferency in the things of the world; <note place="margin">

In 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Every Creature of God is good, and to be received with thanksgiving.</hi> As Doves every grain they pick look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; ſo ſhould Chriſtians; and therefore if thou doſt abuſe any of his Creatures, thou doſt pervert the end of the moſt High. God did ordain food for thy uſe, to ſatisfie thy hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and not to feed thy gluttony. He gave thee drink to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh thy thirſt, and not to provoke thee to drunkenneſs.

                     <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2 8 9.</note> So that if you abuſe the things of the world, you abuſe that which is none of your own, but Gods. And you know, it is a part of diſhoneſty to abuſe another mans goods. All that you have in the world, they are but borrowed bleſſings, God only hath a right and propriety in them He does but only lend them to us for our uſe, and keeps the propriety of them to himſelf. If there be any thing (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all thoſe things we call our own) may be properly ſaid to be our own, it is our bodies, for that is neareſt us, and yet this is not our own neither; for the Apoſtle ſaies, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19,20. <hi>What, know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, and ye are not your own, but you are bought with a price? therefore glorifie God in your bodies,</hi> &amp; <hi>in your ſpirits which are Gods.</hi> When a man borrows a thing, he that lends it prayes him to uſe it wel. <hi>Eliſha's</hi> Servant borrowing but an Axe to cut down wood, and it falling into the water, cryed, <hi>alas Maſter, 'twas but borrowed,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.5. The mercies you have are rather lent then given you; ſhall I wound a man with his own Weapons? yet thus thou doſt to God, when thou abuſeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his bleſſings.</p>

                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:115133:226"/>with a whirlewind out of the floor, &amp; as the ſmoak out of the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:</hi> there are 5. reſemblances put together in one verſe, ſo that beloved, you ſee theſe compariſons doe make it very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and evident, how uncertain and fading and periſhing all the glory and comforts of the world are.</p>
                  <p>I come now to that which I chiefly intended, and that is, to wind up all in a practicall application. And all that I ſhall do herein, ſhall be to draw out ſeven practicall inſtructions from this generall Doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Is this ſo, <note place="margin">Practicall inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by way of uſe</note> that all the things of this world are paſſing away from us, while they are with us? why then let the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this, wean your affections from all worldly things. Why will you love that much that cannot ſtay with you long. It is the advice that <hi>Solomon</hi> gives in <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. ſaies he, <hi>why wilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that which is not,</hi> (that is) though they are in being, yet not in continuance; <hi>for riches certainly make themſelves wings and flie away.</hi> This conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhould wean our loves from all creature comforts. And though vve look upon the things of the World vvith our eys, yet not vvith our hearts; but let them be fixt, <hi>not upon thoſe things that are ſeen; but upon thoſe things that are not ſeen: for the things that are ſeen are tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; but the things that are not ſeen are eternall,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. they are not vvorthy the looking on, becauſe temporary. In <hi>Sparta,</hi> a City of <hi>Greece,</hi> a man vvas King but one year: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervvards lived in retirement and meanneſs, therefore no man could hardly be gotten to accept of it: ſo ſhould the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the fading nature of all vvorldly things, cauſe us to vvithdravv our affections from them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the faſhion of this vvorld be paſſing avvay, then let this excite and ſtir up your ſoules to look after the things of another World, vvhich are more permanent and laſting. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> compares the World to an Eele; and you know the harder you hold an Eele, the ſooner it will ſlip out of your hands; ſo the things of the world, the faſter you think to hold them, the ſooner it will ſlide from you, and therefore labour to lay hold upon Chriſt, and grace, and glory, upon Heaven
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115133:226"/>and happineſs. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.14. (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>here we have no continuing City, therefore let us ſeek one to come.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had no continuance here, therefore they lookt for one to come, even <hi>a City whoſe builder and maker was God,</hi> they lookt after the things of another world, that would not paſſe away as theſe do. As in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. <hi>we look not to the things which are ſeen, that are temporall, but to the things which are not ſeen that are eternall.</hi> You have another notable Text for this purpoſe, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.15,16,17. it is ſpoken of the godly Patriarks, that <hi>if they had been mindfull of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned; but they deſired a better Countrey, that is, an heavenly.</hi> Becauſe they did not look after their own Land, the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> therefore they did declare that they had a better Countrey in their eye, which they did look after, namely, a heavenly Kingdom. The King of <hi>Sparta</hi> that year he was King, ſent a great deal of Treaſure into the place of his baniſhment, that he might live well ever after: ſo ſhould Chriſtians while they are here, lay up treaſure in Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.19,20. (Beloved) if the things of this world be ſo vain and fading, and uncertain, let us look after the things of a better world.</p>

If it be ſo, that this world is ſo fading and vaniſhing, then labour to be convinced of the truth of it, and let your hearts be ſenſible of the vanity and uncertainty of all things here below. I may ſay of them as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.22. <hi>All theſe things periſh with the uſing.</hi> No ſooner are you graſping of the world, but it goes from you. We have no more hold of theſe earthly things, then of a flock of Birds, I cannot ſay they are mine, though they ſit in my yard: The glory of <hi>Ephraim</hi> is ſaid to flie away like a Bird. The world like a Noſe-gay withers while you are ſmelling to it, as ſnow melts while it is in the hands of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. At the inthronization of Popes, one uſed to go before him, burning a wad of ſtraw, or flax, crying, <hi>ſic tranſit gloria mundi.</hi> It is an admirable obſervation that a learned man hath upon the names of the two firſt men that were born into the world, <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel;</hi> ſaies he, we may learn this Leſſon from 
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115133:227"/>their very names. <hi>Cain</hi> here ſignifies poſſeſſion, and <hi>Abel</hi> here ſignifies vanity; to ſhew that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did ſee nothing but vanity in all their poſſeſſions. And oh that you that are the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> that have a great deal leſſe of the world then <hi>Adam</hi> had, that you would not ſet your hearts upon the vanities and uncertainties of this world, that are ſo ſoon gone away from you.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If this be ſo, that all the comforts of the world are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing away, then this ſhews the folly and madneſs of thoſe men whoſe eager purſuits are after fading vanities. O what a madneſs is it for men to be eager in their purſuits of theſe tranſient and fading things, and in the mean time neglect theſe things that are of a greater excellency and duration: and yet there are a world of ſuch fools and mad men amongſt us, that ſeek after vanities, and neglect durable and laſting riches. O how fooliſh are many men in the world, that are eagerly imployed about the mean and low buſineſſes of the world, and in the mean time neglect the great affairs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, like <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> who imployed himſelf in making hafts for knives, and neglected the waighty affairs of his Kingdom, or like <hi>Archimedes,</hi> who was drawing mathematicall lines, and never took care to ſave the City nor his own life. It is ſtoried of <hi>Caligula,</hi> an Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> (and for which he is befool'd of all that ever writ of him) that having prepared and ſet out a very great Navy of Ships, when his men thought he would have done great exploits, and have conquered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Kingdoms with them, he contrary to all their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, commanded them to go and load all their Ships with Cockle ſhells and pibble ſtones, and ſo return again: Juſt ſuch fools are many men, that trouble themſelves in purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Cockle ſhells and pibble ſtones, the fading vanities of this world, and neglect the looking after the firm and durable, and ſubſtantiall riches of the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If the things of this world be ſo fading, then from hence we may ſee the diſparity and vaſt difference there is between earthly things and heavenly. The glory of this world paſſeth away; but you cannot ſay ſo of the things of Heaven: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer weares as your Garments, the other as the body weares
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115133:227"/>not away. Riches are a vanity uſed to and fro, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.6. but grace is durable riches, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.24. <hi>The graſs withereth, and e flower thereof faileth; but the word of God, that endureth for ever:</hi> by graſſe and the flower of graſſe, is meant all the glory of this world, and theſe all fade and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther away; <hi>but the word of God that endureth for ever,</hi> (that is) the work of grace wrought in your hearts by the word that ſhall laſt and endure forever; that ſhall remain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue when all the glory of the world paſſeth away, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.17. <hi>The world paſſeth away and the luſts thereof; but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever.</hi> (Beloved) here you ſee the great diſparity between heavenly things and the things of the world, as riches and honours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Suppoſe thou art an Heir to a Crown or Kingdom, yet theſe are but temporall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances, and laſt but for a ſeaſon, but an heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that endureth for ever, as in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</hi> All your comforts here below, are but momentary comforts, riches and honours are not everlaſting; but God and Chriſt, and grace and Heaven, and glory is everlaſting: theſe are comforts that ade not away, but laſt for ever: your earthly parents are not fverlaſting; but your Father in Heaven is everlaſting, <hi>Eſa</hi> 9.6. <hi>eour livee here are not everlaſting, but your life in Heaven is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yaſting, Luke</hi> 18 30. here below you rejoyce one day, and lweep another; but in Heaven your joy ſhall be everlaſting, as in <hi>Eſa</hi> 61.7. <hi>Everlaſting joy ſhall be upon their heads;</hi> ſo in 2 Theſ. 2.16. ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>who hath loved us, and given us everlaſting conſolation, &amp;c.</hi> here your comforts are but ſhort; but in Heaven you ſhall have everlaſting conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Here your poſſeſſions are not everlaſting; but there ſhall laſt for ever in Heaven, and here you are ſoon forgotten, and the memory of your names loſt; but in Heaven you <hi>ſhall be had in everlaſting remembrance,</hi> Pſal. 112. verſ. 6.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Are the glory and comforts of the world paſſing away? why then know this for your comfort, that the croſſes and troubles, and afflictions of the world are paſſing away too, <hi>ſlight afflictions which are but for a moment,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. Suppoſe thou art a man of a mean fortune, poor and low
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115133:228"/>in the world, why yet thy poverty ſhall paſſe away: ſuppoſe thou art a man of a ſickly and weak conſtitution, your ſickneſſe ſhall paſſe away too: ſuppoſe thou art impriſoned and in bondage, yet the priſoner ſhall ſhake off his fetters, and his priſon Garments, <hi>Job</hi> 11.16. <hi>thy miſery ſhall paſſe away as a ſtream of water:</hi>
